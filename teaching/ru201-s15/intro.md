## Course overview ##

This is an introductory logic course. We will explore general logical notions such as *truth*, *validity*, and *soundness* in a rigorous and *formal* way. 

Logic is *topic neutral*. 

+ The idea here is that the principles of logic we are looking at are very general, and apply no matter what specific topic (such as politics, physics, or TV shows) we are discussing. 
+ Thus, there is a high reliance on *abstraction*, and we use *symbols* to stand in for specific nouns and verbs in our logical sentences. 
+ So, much of what we do will look a lot like what you might see in a math class, specifically *algebra*.

We will introduce a couple specific *logical systems*, define *rules* that govern those systems, and use the rules to construct *proofs* of various *theorems* within the system.

## Homework ##

+ 6 homework assignments, only 5 will be graded, lowest throuwn out
+ Homework submitted through Grade Grinder using the textbook software
+ You must have access to the software to do the homework. This means you
  have to purchase the book.
+ You can enter practice submissions to the system and get feedback as many   
  times as you want. So, you should have no trouble getting full credit for 
  the assignments.
+ You officially submit your homework for credit by including the 
  instructor email: *ruphil201s15@gmail.com*
+ Late homework assignments will be docked **3 points** for every day they 
  are past due.

## Exams ##

+ Midterm exams will be taken in class on the dates indicated.
+ The final exam will take place on the scheduled final exam date for this  
  class.  It will take place in this room.
+ The exam format will include multiple choice, fill in the blank, and short 
  answer.  You will also be expected to show proficiency with the logic tools 
  we examine, such as *truth tables*, *proofs*, and *determining validity*.
+ Make up exams will only be given under extenuating circumstances, and 
  provided that the student informs me of their need to miss the exam ahead   
  of time.

# Formal Logic #

+ A *formal logical system* is a tool for investigating a specific kind of human reasoning in a rigorous, objective way.
+ Logical systems are defined by the **language** we use to express the statements and rules of the system.

## Defining the language ##

+ All languages have three main components:
    - Vocabulary: the basic meanginful units of the language (*the words*)
    - Syntax: the rules for putting basic units together to form larger 
      meaningful units (*the sentences*)
    - Semantics: the rules for assigning meanings to the sentences 
+ This is true for *natural* languages (English, Tagalog) as well as the 
  formal languages we will investigate.
+ But formal languages are different in that the rules of the language are 
  *rigorously* and *explicitly* determined before we start using them.

## Using the language ##

+ Logical languages are interesting in their own right. But their main function is to help us explain what makes for good and bad **reasoning**.
+ The primary tool of reasoning is the **argument**. Arugments involve:
    - Premises: one or more sentences used as the foundation of the reasoning.
    - Conclusion: a sentence that is the end point of the reasoning.
    - Support relation: the explanation of how the premises *lead to* the 
      conclusion.
+ Thus, we also need our language to define *relations between sentences* to explain how good arguments work.
+ Using the components we defined earlier, we can do just that:
    - Syntactic relations: ways to *transform* one sentence into another one.
    - Semantic properties of sentences: *tautology*, *contradiction*
    - Semantic relations between sentences: *equivalence*, *consequence*

# The language of FOL #

+ Our textbook introduces us to the language of *first order logic*, or 
  **FOL**.

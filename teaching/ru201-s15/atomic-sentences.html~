        ## The language of FOL 

        + As for all languages, we start by defining the following components of FOL:
            - Vocabulary
            - Syntax
            - Semantics

        --

        ## The vocabulary of FOL

        + We are going to use FOL to talk about simple geometical **objects**, their **properties**, and **relations** that hold between such objects. 
        + So, the vocabulary of FOL includes: <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
            - Objects: *a, b, c, ...* <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
            - Properties: *cube, sphere, yellow, green, ...* <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
            - Relations: *next-to, front-of, bigger-than, ...* <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

        --

        ## Kinds of vocabulary

        + We can talk about objects either **specifically**, or in **general**:
            - Specific: "Cube a is bigger than sphere b" <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
            - General: "Some cube is bigger than every sphere" <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
        + <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> When we speak of objects specifically, we use letters from the beginning of the alphabet (*a,b,c*); these are called **constants**.
        + <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> When we speak of objects generally, we use letters from the end of the alphabet (*x,y,z*); these are called **variables**.

        --

        ## The syntax of FOL

        + Now, we need rules for putting our vocabulary together into meaningful sentences.

        --

        ## The semantics of FOL

        + Our primary concern in using FOL is in determining what sentences are **true** and what sentences are **false**.

            - We will start on Ch. 2: The logic of atomic sentences
            - In this chapter, we start to investigate how to *reason* with FOL.

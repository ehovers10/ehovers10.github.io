        <!-- .slide: id="lang-fol" -->
        ## The language of FOL 

        + As for all languages, we start by defining the following components of FOL:
            - Vocabulary
            - Syntax
            - Semantics

        --

        ## The vocabulary of FOL

        + We are going to use FOL to talk about simple geometical **objects**, their **properties**, and **relations** that hold between such objects. 
        + So, the vocabulary of FOL includes: <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
            - Objects: *a, b, c, ...* <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
            - Properties: *cube, sphere, yellow, green, ...* <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
            - Relations: *next-to, front-of, bigger-than, ...* <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

        --

        ## Kinds of vocabulary

        + We can talk about objects either **specifically**, or in **general**:
            - Specific: *"Cube a is bigger than sphere b"* <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
            - General: *"Some cube is bigger than every sphere"* <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
        + <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> When we speak of objects specifically, we use letters from the beginning of the alphabet (*a,b,c*); these are called **constants**.
        + <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> When we speak of objects generally, we use letters from the end of the alphabet (*x,y,z*); these are called **variables**.

        --

        ## The syntax of FOL

        + Now, we need rules for putting our vocabulary together into meaningful sentences.

        --

        ## The semantics of FOL

        + Our primary concern in using FOL is in determining what sentences are **true** and what sentences are **false**.

        <!-- .slide: id="tarski" -->
        ## Tarski's world

        <img src="./images/tarski-w.jpg" title="Tarski's world">

        --

        + Tarski's world is a tool for investigating *semantic relations* between sentences of FOL.
        + To do this, we first construct a world and place various kinds of objects within it.
        + Based on the structure of the world we create, some sentences of FOL will be true and others will be false.
        + And the **truth value** of one sentence might *depend on* the truth value of another. 

        ---

        <!-- .slide: id="boole" -->
        ## Boole 

        <img src="./images/boole-w.jpg" title="Boole">

        --

        + Boole is a tool for investigating the *semantic properties* of sentences of FOL
        + In FOL, the meaning of a sentence is its **truth conditions**
            - Truth conditions are the truth value that the sentence has in every **possible world**
        + To represent truth conditions, we set up a table that lists all the possibilities that might influence the truth value of a sentence.
            - We then fill in the table with the truth value that the sentence has in each possibility.
            We call the result a **truth table**

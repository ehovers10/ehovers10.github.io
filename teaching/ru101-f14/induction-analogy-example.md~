Lucy's analogical reasoning

Primary analogues: Tom's Chevy
--Lucy's other friends with Tom's model/year also with good fuel economy
--An additional Chevy owner who gets poor fuel economy (counter-analogy)
--All analogues buy gas at same station, have same mechanic, and use same engine additives
  --one of these factors could be the cause rather than the model/year type

Secondary analogue: A Chevy

Proposed property: Good fuel economy
--"at least as good as Tom's"
--"exactly the same as Tom's"

Similarities
--padded steering wheel, tachometer, fabric upholstery, tinted windows, premium sound system, white paint
--engine size, curb weight, aerodynamic body, gear ratio, tires

Disanalogy
--Lucy's potential Chevy has a turbo charger, Lucy is an aggressive driver while Tom is conservative
--Tom's has the turbo charger, and he is the aggressive driver

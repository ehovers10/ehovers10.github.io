# Correctible inquiry #

Inquiry is a process whereby individuals can use their independent stores of information to mutually expand their understanding of the world around them.

Discourse need not fulfill the needs of inquiry, and inquiry need not take the form of a discourse.  Still, the two conceps are closely related, and investigation into the form of one can unlock insight into the form of the other.

The tradition of update semantics (kamp and heim, groenendijk and stokhof, van den berg, bittner, and brasovanu) has long maintained that linguistic discourse cannot be appropriately understood as a sequence of independent utterances.  Instead, there are essential, semantic relations between utterances.

The idea that discourse is dynamic is both trivial and novel. Discourse takes place in real time, and a conversation builds as new contributions are added. But it doesn't build as a mere sequence of independent utterances. Instead, later utterances depend on prior ones for their interpretability.

## Modeling inquiry ## 

Inquiry is a goal directed process whereby one or more individuals use the cognitive and empirical resources at their disposal to improve their understanding of the world. Discourse is a linguistic process whereby multiple individuals exchange information. Discourse need not but frequently does implement inquiry, so insight into the nature and structure of one of these processes can inform understanding of the nature and structure of the other process.

I take as my starting point the idea that linguistic discourse, represented primarily by two or more interlocutors engaged in conversation, is a form of multiperson inquiry. Inquiry has both an operative definition and a teleological definition. The purpose of inquiry is to improve one's picture of the world. The process by which one achieves that goal is what is open for investigation here.

When individuals engage in a joint inquiry, they presume to cooperatively exchange information for the purpose of mutually improving their picture of the world. In this sense, inquiry is a teleological concept; it is whatever process brings us to a greater understanding of the world around us. 

What is inquiry
What is discourse
What is collaboration
What is disagreement

It is commonly held by discourse theorists that underlying communicative exchange is a cooperative principle. In order to successfully interpret another speaker we work with them to align our communicative goals. But much discourse seems anything but cooperative. Pinker et al. [-@pinker2008] have suggested that communication is an amalgam of cooperation and conflict; that is, a game in which interlocutors are constantly vying to maintain that their interests are preserved in the end. 

Another apparent sign of the limits of cooperation in discourse is the ubiqitous appearance of disagreement in communication. 

Inquiry and discourse are both processes. Discourse is primarily linguistics and inquiry is primarily epistemic. Thus, they are independent concepts. Still, insights into the structure and nature of one may inform understanding of the nature and structure of the other.

Stalnaker - On What's in the Head
-context and content (p. 186-7)

``But on the causal-informational account of representation, informational content is \textit{essentially} relative to a range of alternate possibilities that are determined by general facts about the causal structure of the world in which the organism functions. It is internal states of the represnetor, on this kind of account, that contain informations (or misinformation), but the system of causal relationships in virtue of which those internal states contain information cannot itself be something internal to the representor.  The theorist, in describing the internal states of a representor in terms of informational content, has some choice in the range of alternatives relative to which content is defined. It may even be that for any possibility we can describe, there is a context in which we can ask whether the representor's beliefs distinguish that possibility from certain others. But this does not imply that there is an absolutely neutral context, a context free of all presuppositions about the environment, relative to which content ascriptions make sense.''

Stalnaker v. Williamson on knowledge as mental state
--both think it is
--stalnaker's version stems from his conception of mental states as holistic and essentially contextual.  the mental is whatever contributes to the causal-informational explanation of the larger system.  
-- s's problem then becomes how to distinguish knowledge from belief, as they will overlap in many cases

--williamson's version comes from the inability to give a factorization of knowledge.
--w's problem then becomes how to make sense of external mentality while remaining thoroughly realist about the mental.

--s seems to give up a bit on mental realism when he allows that the theorist plays such a large role in the specification of mental content.

Williamson - Is knowing a state of mind?

1. Mental state transparency is not a reason to deny that knowledge is a mental state.  True, one's knowledge is not always transparent (failure of K not-K), but neither are many uncontroversial mental states (not always know one's hopes).

2. Privileged access doesn't turn the trick.  If mental states require privileged access, knowledge has it.

3. Failure of transparency means that indsicriminable mental states may be different mental states.

4. (pp. 5-6 very confusing) CIrcularity of the internalist skeptical argument: THe claim is that since one can't distinguish between the good state and the bad state, one can't know that one is in the good state.  But to distinguish the bad case from the good is just to know that one doesn't know in one's present (bad) case. 

5. Knowing cannot be analyzed into a conjunction of mental states with a non-mental condition. 

5a. Experience with proposed such analyses indicate this fact.

5b. Knowing matters, but why would the complex proposed analyses be so important to us?

5c. Good reason, from its philosophical interest, to think that knowledge may well be conceptual bedrock.

5d. When combined with a methodological principle like Russell's acquaintance principle, conceptual analysis has a good point.  But we've left that methodology behind.  No need to continue carrying on the project. 

??What if ``justification'' carries the externality of knowing? (Think of Harman's example of Tom, his twin, and his mother)
??Is conjunctive analysis the only way to capture a reasonable conception of non-mental?

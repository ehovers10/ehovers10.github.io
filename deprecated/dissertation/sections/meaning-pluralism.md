## Meaning pluralism ##

It is broadly recognized that when an individual utters a sentence in coversation, there are a wide variety of *things* it is appropriate to claim that the person has *said*, or *conveyed*, by way of that utterance.  But acceptance of this unconvroversial form of meaning pluralism still leaves a number of questions unanswered:

1. How many things are conveyed by the utterance?
2. How are the things so conveyed to be classified and grouped?
3. In what ways to the things conveyed relate to each other?
4. How is interpretation of the utterance in context impacted by each of the things conveyed?


## Meaning categorizations ##

1. Speech acts (illocutionary force)
2. Content
3. 


## Austin's classification ##

1. Constantive utterances: appraisable for truth
2. Performative utterances: appraisable for success
    - Locutionary acts: saying anything at all
    - Illocutionary acts: saying something with a particular force
    - Perloctionary acts: things accomplished by virtue of saying something with a particular force

## Reduction strategy ##

Logic of speech acts?
Levels of meaning?

## Motivation ##

There are two opposing forces in interpretation of utterances in conversation. One suggests that utterances convey a   multitude of distinct bits of information, each of which requires an independent interpretive treatment.  The other is that there are multiple inroads between these distinct bits of information, apparently forcing interpretation to move in and out amongst them.  The question is how to reconcile these two forces of interpretation.

First, some evidence of the first force:

+ Conventional implicature and independence from at-issue content
    - They resolve the QUD in different ways
    - Not-at-issue content fail to interact with sentential connectives (they project)
+ Illocutionary force and differences in fundamental nature of the lingusitic entity.

Next, evidence of the latter force:

+ Anaphoric reference to elements of all levels of meaning
+ Embeddability of apparent force carrying particles

Proposed integrations

+ Potts, following Kartunnen and Peters: keep them separated
+ ABH, Murray and Starr, one interpretive platform on which different functions can be performed
    - Content imposed v. content proposed

Worry for both: embeddability

## Potts: CIs v. At-issue content ##

1. CIs are invariant under presupposition holes and plugs
    - "Sheila says that Chuck, a confirmed psychopath, is fit to watch the kids."
    - Chuck's being a psychopath escapes the plug of the say report. Sheila isn't committed to it.
    - So, the CI is not actually embedded; it scopes over the say report.
    - At-issue content depends on its presuppositions, but is fully interpretable independently of its CIs.
2. CIs are always speaker oriented, but at-issue content isn't always.
    - "Sue wrongly believes that it is raining"
    - The embedded clause is at-issue, but the speaker is not committed to it.
    - This is again an embeddability issue. Commitment (or assertion) is shielded in embeddings.
3. They are both entailments
    - But multidimensionality can account for this.
    - So can a scope-shifting account with only one level of meaning.

## ABH: Appositives and anaphora ##

1. Anaphoric links cross appositive boundaries.
    - "John, who played tennis with a woman, played golf with her too."
    - *her* in the at-issue content can find the antecedent *a woman* in the appositive.
2. If we take anaphora to be an issue of semantics proper, then this raises an issue of whether we would expect the independence thesis to extend to anaphora as well.
    - While multidimensional theories have recognized the ability of anaphora to cross boundaries, the extent is underappreciated.
    - There is also a tension when anaphora resolution is brought into the semantic fold.
3. The independence thesis fails.
    - We need an account that respects the informational distinctness of appositive content.
    - But one that also respects the interconnections between the types of information.

    | One way to approach this problem is by providing a fundamentally unidimensional semantics in which the    
    | differential discourse and projective behavior of appositives is captured within a single, integrated meaning  
    | representation for the sentence/discourse. Alternatively, we could investigate how the notion of 
    | multidimensionality can be extended to incorporate systematic connections between various meaning dimensions. We 
    | tend to favor the former conception and we will frequently talk about the challenge summarized in the previous 
    | paragraph in those terms, though we acknowledge that both ways of thinking about the analysis we develop may prove 
    | fruitful and lead to a more nuanced view of the multidimensional versus unidimensional distinction.

4. At-issue and not-at-issue are distinguished by *how* they enter the common ground.

### Question/answer congruence ###

The star bit of data that is marshalled in support of this proposal is that of question/answer congruence. Compare the responses to the following question:

(A) Who ate the last cookie?
	(i) [Caitlin]<sub>f</sub> ate the last cookie.
	(ii) Caitlin ate the last [cookie]<sub>f</sub>

While response (i) is a perfectly natural answer, the placement of focus in (ii) makes it stand out as unacceptable.  Following (@hamblin1958), a (suitably contextually constrained) semantic value for question A might be:

(A') {_Albert ate the last cookie_, _Betsy ate the last cookie_, _Caitlin ate the last cookie_, ...}

And, the proposed analysis of focus renders the following focus semantic values for the given responses:

(i') {_Albert ate the last cookie_, _Betsy ate the last cookie_, _Caitlin ate the last cookie_, ...}

(ii') {_Caitlin ate the last apple_, _Caitlin ate the last beet_, _Caitlin ate the last cookie_, ...}

The alternative set generated by the focus in (i) is the same as the semantic value for question A, and that generated by the focus in (ii) is not.  Add in the proposed felicity condition, and you have a great explanation of question/answer congruence.

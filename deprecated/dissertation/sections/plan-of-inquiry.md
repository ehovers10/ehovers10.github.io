But now consider the following discourse:

(@bears) - Bears are dangerous.
	 - [Grizzly]~cf~ bears are dangerous.
	
The response in the example above exhibits what is often called contrastive focus.  While there are some differences in the intonational patters between the focus mentioned earlier and contrastive focus (cf. Gundel), there is reason to think that much the same mechanism is at work in the interpretational effects of both.  But this example poses a challenge for the proposed analysis of focus interpretation.  There is no trouble generating an alternative set for the focused element.  The issue is that there is no explicit antecedent for the generated set.

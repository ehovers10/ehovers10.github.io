## C. S. Peirce ## {#peirce}

For C. S. Peirce, scientific inquiry involved 3 distinct components, each of which provides a distinctive justification for the outputs of the process, and each of which is subject to a distinctive form of evaluation.  An initial application of the abductive phase generates a set of hypotheses which serve as potential answers to the posed scientific issue. This phase is the least regulated of the components of scientific inquiry. Peirce maintained that there are rules governing proper application of creative abduction, but many philosophers of science have maintained that analysis of this process is limited to the psychology of scientists. A deductive phase generates necessary consequences of the hypotheses generated in the first phase.  The rules of deductive logic govern the outputs of this phase.  In inductive phase then steps in to test the hypotheses by comparing their deductive commitments to the outputs of empirical testing.  And finally, a phase of selective abduction uses the results of the inductive phase to select the best hypothesis for whatever purposes such a selection is needed: further testing, belief updating, or being proclaimed as scientific fact.

If Peirce's suggestion that these components represent general processes of human reasoning, then we would suspect that inquiry generally manifests the same set of steps.  As an inquiry in its own right, discourse, too, should exhibit each of these components.

## C. S. Peirce ## {#peirce}

For C. S. Peirce, scientific inquiry involved 3 distinct components, each of which provides a distinctive justification for the outputs of the process, and each of which is subject to a distinctive form of evaluation.  Given a proposed scientific inquiry, *abduction* generates a set of hypotheses which serve as potential answers to the issue. *Deduction* then generates necessary consequences of the hypotheses generated in the first phase. It is followed by phse of *induction* in which the hypotheses are tested by comparing their deductive commitments to the outputs of empirical investigation. Finally, a phase of *selective* abduction uses the results of the inductive phase to select the best hypothesis for whatever purposes such a selection is needed: further testing, belief updating, or being proclaimed as scientific fact.

Abduction, in both its creative and selective forms have been subject to severe criticism as logically governed elements of inquiry. Many philosophers of science have maintained that analysis of creative abduction, sometimes called the *context of discovery*, ought to be limited to investigating the psychology of scientists, and that selective abduction, or *inference to the best explanation*, is nothing more than a trivial extension of inductive reasoning. But Peirce^[Along with others. Cf. (CITE XXX).] maintained that abduction is a logically governed process in its own right, and that its application is subject to evaluation and criticism. 

If Peirce is right that these components each represent general processes of human reasoning, then we would suspect that inquiry generally manifests the same set of steps.  As an inquiry in its own right, discourse, too, should exhibit each of these components. Questions play a role parallel to creative abduction, supposition captures the function of deduction, and assertion is pretty clearly a selective process. But for the inductive phase, we need a means of submitting hypotheses to a testing process, and posits, along with their associated corrections, fill this role nicely.

## More on abduction ##

The communicative exchange is an inquiry, and as in scientific inquiry, it has two components: the context of discovery and the context of justification. 

Inquiry involves two methods of information accumulation.  One is by way of incorporating new information into the stock of accepted information.  The other is by expanding the question state to incorporate new possibilities for investigation.

The expansion of the question state is akin to the abductive phase within the context of discovery. But there are two kinds of abduction commonly recognized. The first of these is when a set of hypotheses is selected from whithin a preestablished list of possibilities, and is known as selective abduction. The second involves the generation of genuinely new hypotheses, and goes under the title of creative abduction.

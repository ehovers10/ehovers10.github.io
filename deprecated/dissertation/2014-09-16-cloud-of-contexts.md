In their _CIA Leaks_ von Fintel and Gillies survey the evidence in favor of adding a variable slot for contexts of assessment against which sentence contents get evaluated. They show that the intuitions that theorists elicit in favor of this added parameter of evaluation are not nearly as robust as those theorists have claimed.  They also provide cases in which the most natural intuitions run counter to the predictions of such context of assessment enahanced semantic theories.

At the end of the paper, they offer a programmatic positive proposal to explain the data.  The gist of their suggestion is that rather than add an obligatory context of assessment parameter, we can instead interpret the already available context parameter to pick out a perhaps non-singleton set of contexts relevant to content evaluation.  There are numerous situations in which sentence interpretation requires an appeal to features of context.  But an intertretive theory of language need not be able to identify a unique context for every content.  In suggesting that contents may sometimes be evaluated against a _cloud of contexts_ Von Fintel and Gillies' proposal allows for a certain amount of underspecification of utterance meaning.

One of the primary advantages of this underspecification is that it opens an avenue for explaining the variable nature of intuitions regarding the evaluation of certain sentences.  If a conversational setting doesn't determine a unique context of evaluation, then we can make sense of why different people assess utterances in that setting differently.  Every utterance content must be evaluated against some context, but different contexts may be warrantedly salient to different interpreters.

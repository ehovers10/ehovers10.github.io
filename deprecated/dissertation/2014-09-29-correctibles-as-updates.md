Corrective language has an interesting dual function:
- It denies an element of a preceding contribution to discourse
- It provides a positive contribution that is related in a salient way to previous discourse

If we take corrective language to be a natural kind in the communicative exchange (as opposed to who takes it to be a grabbag of pragmatic tools) then there remains a question as to whether it induces a sui generis change to the linguistic scoreboard, or if it can be cashed out in terms of a series of changes that are common to other communicative contributions. (cf. whether intuitions of "faultless disagreement" motivate a novel understanding of meaning, or simply a greater articulation of interpretation. whether intuitions of "contingent apriori" force us to recognize epistemic possibilities that are metaphysical impossibilities, or if utterances can give rise to multiple propositions with incompatible contents)

Relevant here is the von Fintel and Gillies classic. Contrast it with the de Sa or Lasersohn characterization.  Contrast also the standard relativst move of separating kinds of belief in terms of functional role.  Two people in Cleveland believe the same thing, which they report by saying "I am in Cleveland"

So, is there one update over a different kind of thing, or is it two sequential updates over the same old things (information states as sets of worlds, perhaps with drefs, orderings, or partitions)?

Option 1: corrective discourse requires a new understanding of meaning.  Not just updates, but posits.  Not just eliminations, structurings, and dref adding, but tentatives.

Option 2: corrective discourse is a subset of update semantics.  The same basic units are involved.  We deny updates, we eliminate worlds, and we structure info states.  Perhaps to accommodate the sequential, single utterance contributions we need to separate the roles in terms of mood.  (cf. Sarah Murray  and the problem with combining)

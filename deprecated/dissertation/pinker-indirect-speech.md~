Three part theory
+ Communincation is not purely cooperative. Interlocutors sometimes have 
  conflicting goals.
    - Indirect speech can convey a message without fully committing the speaker to 
      that message.
    - This is because it is uncertain whether the message was actually intended.
    - This uncertainty provides a way for the speaker to skirt around presumed 
      goals of the hearer that may conlflict with the speaker's.
+ But legal constraints aren't the only conflicts communicators may have. There are 
  also social power structures that generate conflicting goals.
+ Sufficient uncertainty to skirt conflicts can be maintained even when the 
  speaker's intentions are quite evident.
    - There is a cognitive difference between certainty and anything less that it, 
      and indirect speech exploits this difference.
    - Direct speech provides the interlocutors with fully iterated common 
      knowledge, but indirect speech only provides the first level, so higher level 
      uncertainty remains.

There are some avenues along which I can choose to talk about my project.  It is a project about the dynamics of language in actual conversational exchanges.  It is an implementation of what I take to be an essential element of the progress of inquiry.  At this level, questions of mental representation, processing loads, and levels of cognitive interaction are relevant. 

But it is also an attempt to provide a logical system to function as a basis model of the process.  With this end in mind, questions of validity and meta-theorems (is it persistent? is it idempotent?) become relevant. 

I want to play both sides of this divide because I'm not sure that the divide makes perfect sense.  I have no qualms with the idea of theorizing at different levels.  And the level of processing does seem to bear important differences to the level of logical implementation.  But might there be a different approach that either unifies those levels or draws the strata a different way?

Jazschzolt {% cite %} rails against the positing of levels of meaning on the basis of some version of Ockham's Razor. But the way that she pushes formal representation to one side suggests a divide in levels of theorization about linguistic facts that should be no less susceptible to the knife. 

So, we have two levels based distinctions:
- levels of interpretation, defined by their influence on each other in coming to an all things considered interpretation of an utterance
- levels of theorizing, defined by the role they play in the broad project of understanding language

A fun question is in what sense either of these strata explosions are real.  And they need not be orthogonal.  On it's face, both are about understanding language.  One involves in situ processing, while the other suggests some sort of imprinting in cognitive architecture.

Recent liturature has emphasized the need for recognizing two ways in which information is injected into the conversational background. One way involves an imposing of the information on the common ground.  This is performed by the speaker without any input from the listener. But updates need not be so dictatorial; proposed updates are put up for consideration, but not entered into the common ground without acceptance by the listner.

The primary use for this distinction in methods of update has been to model the distinction between at-issue and not-at-issue content.  The idea is that these two interpretational elements do not represent different dimensions of contribution to discourse.  Instead, they are two ways in which content can be contributed to the discourse.

This more nuanced model of the communicative exchange highlights an important feature of linguistic interpretation.  It is a highly interactive endeavor.  Interlocutors don't build a conversation simply by contributing independent pieces; They work together to construct the pieces that get added to the conversational background.

The notion of proposed updates gives listeners an avenue for providing input regarding a speaker's contribution.  They can either accept or reject the proposal.  But this input is itself too limiting. The interactive process is more developed than this.  Listeners can additionally correct speaker contributions, or fill in holes purposefully left open by the speaker.

A highly interactive communicative exchange requires a model, and the simple impose/propose distinction does not offer enough structure to capture it.  However, an adequate model does not require any completely novel additions to standard update semantics.  What it does require is a new understanding of what speaker contributions look like at the level of logical form.  Every interactive element requires a moving part that can be potentially modified by a listener.

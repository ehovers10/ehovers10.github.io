	<h2>overview</h2>

	<p>My primary research interests are in philosophy of language and cognitive science. More specifically, I'm interested in formal models of the influence of context on natural language interpretation. My dissertation explores the importance of speculation and dispute in inquiry. I contend that conversation commonly realizes a collaborative inquiry, which is to say that successful contribution to the discourse requires the efforts of multiple parties working in concert, not just serially. The goal of the project is to explain, motivate, and provide a model of implementation for this idea, what I call collaborative discourse dynamics. A notable feature of the model is that it gives <em>conjectures</em> pride of place alongside conversational moves such as <em>assertions</em> and <em>questions</em>.</p>

	<p>Below, you will find links to elements of my dissertation. You can also explore a few searchable bibliographies I've compiled. Lastly, I've included some web tools that I have put together.</p>

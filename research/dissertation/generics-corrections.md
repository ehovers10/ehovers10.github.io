Posit correct pairs

The following discourse exchange seems quite natural:

A. Bears are dangerous.
B. [Grizzly bears] are dangerous.

The B response serves as a correction of the A proposal.  Thus, we should consider these as a discourse pair, and attempt to give them complementary structures. 

First, a conceptual reconstruction.  In using the generic construction, A is suggesting a general feature of a class of individuals without committing to the property holding of all individuals necessarily. B disagrees with A's proposal. But flat denial seems out of place.  A has put herself out there with a suggestion to spark further conversation, and simple denial derails this broader conversational attempt. Also, flat denial of generics is not so easy.  Generic statements are resiliant. So, B gives a constructive correction, picking up on A's conversational gambit but modifying it to align with B's individual scoreboard.

Of course, B's response could have taken any of many fellicitous forms:
- [Hungry, mama bears] are dangerous.
- [Cornered bears] are dangerous.
- [Polar bears] are dangerous.

Thus, A's proposal only minimally constrains B's options.  But general relevance constraints also suggest limits to B's options.

Our proposed structure for A's proposal must accommodate the open endedness of fellicitous responses it encourages.

My proposal is that A's proposal involves both creative and selective abduction in one. That is, there is a novel introduction of an issue, in this case, an issue of what classes of things encompass only dangerous things. But A is not satisfied to merely raise the issue; she desires also to offer a resolution. Thus, she selects within the issue, a salient satisfier class. This combined offering I call a posit. What's important here is that posits do not have the discursive profile of assertions.  They are resiliant to denial, in that they do not commit the speaker to the standard assertion commitments whether that be knowledge, ability to defend against any criticism, or willingness to retract when challenged. This can be seen in the following sorts of exchange:

A. Bears are dangerous.
B. Not all bears.
A. I didn't mean that.
A. Still, most of them.
A. Still, generally so.
A. But you get my point.

A needn't give up her initial claim, even though there may be a slight concession to B's unhelpful denial.

So, here are the criteria we must meet:
1. Proposal introduction
2. Resolution suggestion
3. Assertive resiliance
4. Response constraints
5. Focus coherence

I think all of these criteria can be met with a standard update semantics with typed discourse referents. The key to the resiliance and constrants is that the utterance involves different parts, each of which is separately entered into the conversational record and available for anaphoric reference or correction.

Presentation of the issue, default resolution

[x,I : x=P(w,a) & I={<w,v>: [D(x)]^w iff [D(x)]^v}

Steps to developing the semantics of posit corrections
1. Separate the issue introduction from the resolution to allow for differential correction.
2. Choose whether to have default involve the whole domain or the subset thereof pertaining to the plural used.
3. Characterize the uniformity presupposition

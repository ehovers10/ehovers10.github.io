# Dispute in discourse #

Discourse is a useful way for individuals to use their disparate information sets to mutually expand their understanding of the world.  Success in this endeavor would seem to require significant cooperation among the individual participants in the discourse.  But, on its face, discourse is full of non-cooperative, disputative conversational moves.  How, then, is dispute used in discourse?

## Disagreement as a linguistic tool ##

Disagreement has been a bit of a star figure in recent debates in the philosophy of language. Primarily, it has been used as a tool for assessing the adequacy of different proposals for the semantic contribution of certain expressions. Genuine disagreements, as opposed to spurious or merely apparent ones, intuitively require in the linguistic context or the minds of the disputants, the presence of some kind of content toward which the participants have incompatible commitments. 

The contestants in battle disagreement are *absolutism*, *contextualism*, and *relativism*, and the standard scorecard has absolutism and relativism coming out on top in virtue of their ability to secure the requisite constant content across uses of the expression. Contextualism, it is charged, assigns contents to the utterances and thoughts of different individuals that have them incurring different, compatible commitments as a result of their utterances or thoughts. 

Whatever stance we take on the outcome of this debate, and I will have more to say about the issue later on, disagreement does seem to be a valuable tool to have in the linguist's toolkit.  Language users have intuitions about the compatibility of sentences used in discourse, and linguistic theories ought to respect those intutions.

But simply marking the presence of incompatible contents in a discourse is a relatively peripheral role for disagreement to play in lingusitic theorizing. As they stand, the semantic theories considered above give no insight into disputative discourse itself; they merely accord to a greater or lesser extent with one interesting consequence of such discourse. 

Disputative discourse, though, is pervasive, and it would be valuable to have an account that makes sense of the broader role that it plays in the project of cooperative comminicative exchange generally. Throughout the course of this work, I hope to shed some light on this role.  I will indicate what I take the role of disputative discourse to be, provide a model in the update semantic tradition for how to understand (at least one important subclass of) disputative discourse, and apply this model to two active debates within the philosophy of language.

## Discourse as inquiry ##

Discourse between individuals who share a language can take a wide variety of forms, but academic study has been primarily concerned with the subclass of discourses that fall under the heading of cooperative communicative exchanges of information.  These discourses involve two or more individuals engaged in a project of achieving a mutual goal (generally, increasing mutual knowledge), using eachother's stock of information to increase their own. I call this form of discourse *inquiry*.

While moves in an inquiry (discourse contributions) can be as varied as the language allows, there is a small set of contribution types derivable from the goals of inqury:

An individual can submit (propose) information to be taken on as mutually accepted.  We call this contribution an *assertion*.

The end point of an inquiry depends in part on its starting point, which is the issue that is to be resolved by the process of inquiry. An individual can submit a new issue to the inquiry to be taken on as providing a new goal for the inquiry.  We call this contribution a *question*.

### Collaborative discourse pairs ###

Each of these contribution types is associated with an appropriate response.  A contribution and its response constitute a discourse pair [@clark1992]. For assertions, the appropriate response is either acceptance or denial of the proposed addition to the common ground. Call this a proposal/acceptance pair.  For questions, acceptance and denial are also important, which indicates that the question provides a genuine addition to the common ground. But the question is distinct from an assertion in that it calls out for an anwser, and the form of the question constrains the set of appropriate answers.  Call this a question/answer pair.

Sometimes added to this list of contribution types is the *command*, which proposes a non-linguistic demand upon a participant in the inquiry. The appropriate response to such a contribution is to make the world such that the demand is met (or to reject the demand itself).

### Extensions to the standard model of inquiry ###

Inquisitive semantics with attention adds another contribution type, which is not to add any new information to the common ground but to call already present information to attention. The appropriate response to such a contribution is to direct ones further contributions to this highlighted piece of the total common ground.

One method for introducing contribution types is by classifying certain linguistic particles as carriers of that contribution type. For instance, epistemic modals have as their semantic content a test of the common ground. If the test is passed the entire common ground passes through unaltered; if the test is failed, the common ground collapses and a repair is required. But if this was all epistemic modals did, their ubiquity in discourse would be mysterious, as this reduces their contribution to trivial operations on the common ground.  One way of explaining the value of epistemic modals to discourse is in terms of their unique contribution type.  This is not the only possible explanation.  Others have attempted to provide epistemic modals with a more nuanced semantic content, while others attempt to couch their apparent additional contribution in terms of general pragmatic information.

Additionally, there may be a *suppositional* contribution type, which is carried by conditionals. It is opposed to the hidden modal (or double context sensitivity) models of conditionals. 

### Motivating extensions to the inquiry model ###

These extensions of the standard discourse model suggest two tests for incorporating novel contribution types.

+ the presence of an appropriate response condition, and
+ the ability to capture it within the non-content based infrastructure of the model.

## Posits as an extension of the inquiry model ##

I think that there is another contribution type that is distinct from the others listed. It is similar to assertion in that it seems to provide a proposal of added information, and it is similar to a question in that it seems to present an issue for discussion, and it is similar to supposition in that it seems to be less than fully committal. But it is distinct from each of these, and it calls for a unique treatment.  It calls for this treatment in part because it gives rise to an appropriate response condition, and in part because there is a natural postion for it within the non-content based infrastructure of the model of possible world semantics.

Assertion is generally associated with a commitment that it generates for the speaker.  This commitment involves some evidential relation between the asserter and the information conveyed, though it is controversial just what relation it is. But whatever the relation amounts to, it seems clear that we sometimes offer contributions to discourse that go beyond the evidence we have available. And we do this not just as a means of flouting the rules of discourse, but frequently in order to respect the project of the communicative exchange.^[This could be applied to the debate over norms of assertion as a concilliatory position between the knowledge normers and the belief normers.]  

I call this contribution a posit.  In what follows, I'll explore three motivations for recognizing this type of contribution based on the concept of inquiry.  

Posits call for an appropriate response as well, which is a correction.  And the second paper is an exploration of this discourse pair.

Posits are no ad hoc addendum, as they form a natural position within a standard update semantics.  This is explored in the third paper.

## The deep role of dispute in discourse ##

Whatever stance we take on the outcome of this debate, and I will have more to say about the issue later on, disagreement does seem to be a valuable tool to have in the linguist's toolkit.  Language users have intuitions about the compatibility of sentences used in discourse, and linguistic theories ought to respect those intutions.

But simply marking the presence of incompatible contents in a discourse is a relatively peripheral role for disagreement to play in lingusitic theorizing. As they stand, the semantic theories considered above give no insight into disputative discourse itself; they merely accord to a greater or lesser extent with one interesting consequence of such discourse. 

Disputative discourse, though, is pervasive, and it would be valuable to have an account that makes sense of the broader role that it plays in the project of cooperative comminicative exchange generally. Throughout the course of this work, I hope to shed some light on this role.  I will indicate what I take the role of disputative discourse to be, provide a model in the update semantic tradition for how to understand (at least one important subclass of) disputative discourse, and apply this model to two active debates within the philosophy of language.

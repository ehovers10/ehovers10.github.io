# Correctible inquiry #

Inquiry is a process whereby individuals can use their independent stores of information to mutually expand their understanding of the world around them.

Discourse need not fulfill the needs of inquiry, and inquiry need not take the form of a discourse.  Still, the two conceps are closely related, and investigation into the form of one can unlock insight into the form of the other.

The tradition of update semantics (kamp and heim, groenendijk and stokhof, van den berg, bittner, and brasovanu) has long maintained that linguistic discourse cannot be appropriately understood as a sequence of independent utterances.  Instead, there are essential, semantic relations between utterances.



## Modeling inquiry ## 

I take as my starting point the idea that linguistic discourse, represented primarily by two or more interlocutors engaged in conversation, is a form of multiperson inquiry. Inquiry has both an operative definition and a teleological definition. The purpose of inquiry is to improve one's picture of the world. The process by which one achieves that goal is what is open for investigation here.

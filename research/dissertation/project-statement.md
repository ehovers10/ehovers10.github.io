# Correctible inquiry #

Inquiry is a process whereby individuals can use their independent stores of information to mutually expand their understanding of the world around them.

I take as my starting point the idea that linguistic discourse, represented primarily by two or more interlocutors engaged in conversation, is a form of multiperson inquiry. Inquiry has both an operative definition and a teleological definition. The purpose of inquiry is to improve one's picture of the world. The process by which one achieves that goal is what is open for investigation here.

# Levels of dynamism #

Frege claimed that it was folly to ask for the meaning of a word in isolation, instead intoning that it is the thought as a whole that is the proper unit of semantic investigation. The dynamic turn in semantics pointed to linguistic phenomena such as anaphora as evidence that neither can single sentences be fully understood in isolation, thus turning the gaze of semantic theorizing away from individual thoughts and toward the broader linguistic context in which their specific instantiations appear. 

The many varieties of dynamic semantic accounts share in common a model of discourses (be they conversations or texts) in which there is exists a theoretical platform upon which the information of the discourse is built in a stepwise manner, each subsequent contribution to the discourse adding another level or wiping away previous construction. This platform goes variously by names such as *discourse representation*, *conversational scoreboard*, *common ground*, and *information state*. The materials of which discourses are built include *possible worlds*, *situations*, *events*, *discourse referents*, and ordered or unorderered sets thereof.

These semantic theories are dynamic in that they describe how new contributions to a discourse *respond to* and *modify* what has preceded, and discourse is very much dynamic in this sense. But by and large, they fail to capture another way in discourse is dynamic. Contributions to discourse also *anticipate* what is to follow in the discussion, and this feature of how discourses proceed ought to be brought under the umbrella of semantic theory.

# Collaboration and discourse pairs #

Discourse is an essentially collaborative process.  At a superficial level, successful discourse requires that the participants accurately understand each others' contributions.  This requires constant feedback, step retracing, and repair to keep everyone on the same page.  But the importance of collaboration goes deeper than this.  Herb Clark and his contributors (-@clark1992) have documented a variety of discourse maneuvers in which an individual other than the interlocutor who initiates the contribution provides essential input into its completion.  This has led Clark to suggest that discourse contribututions involve two distinct phases: the *initiation* and the *completion*. Crucially, in general, responsibility for the two phases of contribution is distributed among the conversational participants.

Clark is primarily concerned with the phonological and syntactic representation of discourse contribtutions, and with how the collaborative process determines the reference of elements of the contribution. But the same insights extend to the level of semantico-pragmatic representation as well. 

A principle way in which the collaborative nature of discourse is realized is in the way that assertions update the discourse context.  Following Robert Stalnaker (CITE: STALNAKER-ASSERTION), I understand the principle effect of assertion to be the elimination of uncertainty, which is modeled as the elimination of previously open possibilities from the context set. But Stalnaker also recognizes that there are two stages to the impact of an assertion.  The first is an automatic update that takes place implicitly.  It involves incorporating information into the common ground that includes things such as the fact that the speaker is speaking, a record of the salient objects that have been introduced to the context, and perhaps other forms of not-at-issue content of the utterance.  The second stage of assertion involves the restriction of the context set to incorporate the at-issue content of the utterance.  But this second stage does not take place automatically.  Instead, the speaker's fellow interlocutors are given the power to either accept or reject this proposal before the context set is updated.  (It may be that the proposal is entered into the conversational record in some form for the purpose of anaphoric reference later on.) Thus, it is fitting to think of assertion as involving two distinct phases: an initiation, which involves the proposal of the asserted content by the speaker, and a completion, which involves either the acceptance or rejection of the asserted content by the hearer.

Another way in which the semantic level of discoruse representation is collaborative involves questions and answers.  Questions can of course be accepted or rejected, but they also *call for* a particular form of response.  That is, questions present an *issue*, which carries with it certain *fellicity contitions* that acceptable responses must meet, and the question cannot be considered closed until a response meeting those conditions is proffered.  We thus have what we can call a *discourse pair*: an ititiation, which is the issue proposed in the question, and a completion, which is the answer.  The initiation phase presumes the possibility of a completion, and the completion depends upon the issue proposed. And, crucially, the responsibility for the elements of the pair is distributed among the conversational participants. (Interestingly, this means that discourse initiations need not be immediately followed by their completions.  A questions may not be (fully) resolved until after a number of clarificatory amendments or sub-questions are introduced and resolved.)

Discourse pairs thus exhibit a recognizable pattern. A contribution is an initiation if it presumes, or *anticipates* a completion, which is accomplished by means of exerting fellicity conditions on adequate responses.  A contribution is a completion if its content depends on, or *responds to* an initiation from prior discourse.

I think that the deeply collaborative nature of discourse suggests another shift in semantic attention, expanding on the idea of discourse dynamics, and treating discourse pairs as the primary units of semantic evaluation. The novelty to this proposed shift is that semantic evaluation must trespass not only the boundaries between sentences but also the borders of turns taken in the conversational exchange.

# Posits and corrections #

The protagonist of the discussion to follow is what I've taken to calling a *posit*. Posits are speculative informational profferments. In conversational exchange, an individual contributes a posit when he puts forward for discussion information for which he does not possess conclusive evidence.

Because they propose to add information to the common ground, posits are similar to assertions. But posits, as I understand them, are not subject to the same standards to which appropriate assertion is held.

In fact, posits can really only be understood in combination with their natural discourse pair complement, the *correction*. Since they form a discourse pair, posits anticipate corrections, and a correction is constrained to respond appropriately to a posit. 

# The plan for the project #

The goal of this project is to motivate inclusion of posits within a model of the structure of inquiry. The motivation has 5 parts:

1. A development of a deeply collaborative model of discourse dynamics and an appeal for the inclusion of posits within this model via analogy to widely accepted elements of inquiry.

2. A historical and conceptual motivation for the notion of speculation and correction in inquiry.

3. A development of a formal model of posits and corrections within the update semantics tradition.

3. An application of the new proposal to an extant problem in discourse dynamics.

4. An application of the proposal to provide a novel understanding of a current debate in the philosophy of language.

# Collaborative discourse dynamics and types of contribution #

Discourse between individuals who share a language can take a wide variety of forms, but academic study has been primarily concerned with the subclass of discourses that fall under the heading of cooperative communicative exchanges of information.  These discourses involve two or more individuals engaged in a project of achieving a mutual goal (generally, increased mutual knowledge), using eachother's stock of information to increase their own. In this form, discourse implements a jointly undertaken *inquiry*. An inquiry is, in the words of Robert Stalnaker, "the enterprise of forming, testing, and revising beliefs" [-@stalnaker1987 p. ix].

While moves in an inquiry (discourse contributions) can be as varied as the language allows, there is a small set of contribution types derivable from the goals of inqury:

An individual can submit (propose) information to be taken on as mutually accepted.  We call this contribution an *assertion*.

The end point of an inquiry depends in part on its starting point, which is the *issue* that is to be resolved by the process of inquiry. An individual can submit a new issue to the inquiry to be taken on as providing a new goal for the inquiry.  We call this contribution a *question*.

Discourse is a joint endeavor, and each of these contribution types is associated with an appropriate response from the contributor's interlocutors.  A contribution and its response constitute a *discourse pair*. For assertions, the appropriate response is either acceptance or denial of the proposed addition to the common ground. Call this a proposal/acceptance pair.  For questions, acceptance and denial are also important, which indicates that the question provides a genuine addition to the common ground. But the question is distinct from an assertion in that it calls out for an anwser, and the form of the question constrains the set of appropriate answers.  Call this a question/answer pair.

Sometimes added to this list of contribution types is the *command*, which proposes a non-linguistic demand upon a participant in the inquiry. The appropriate response to such a contribution is to make the world such that the demand is met (or to reject the demand itself).

Perhaps unsurprisingly, these contribution types each have an associated linguistic mood. Inquiry is a structured process, in which it is important not only what information is available but also how it is to be put to use in reaching the goal. As an implementation of inquiry, linguistic discourse has conventional means of representing how the information is being put to use by a contribution. But the scope of contribution types is not limited by the set of conventional moods. What is important is that there is a recognizably unique way in which information is put to use to further the goals of the inquiry. 

One motivation for introducing a novel contribution type is by classifying certain linguistic particles as carriers of that type. For instance, a natural model of the semantic value of epistemic modals [@veltman1996, @fintel2010] is that they provide a test of the common ground. If the test is passed the entire common ground passes through unaltered; if the test is failed, the common ground collapses and a repair is required. But if this was all epistemic modals did, their ubiquity in discourse would be mysterious, as their function is reduced to trivial operations on the common ground.  One way of explaining the utility of epistemic modals in discourse is in terms of their unique contribution type. This project has been undertaken within the inquisitive semantics tradition, by accounting for the contribution of epistemic modals as a way of highlighting particular possible worlds within an information state [@groenendijk2014].^[This is, of course, not the only possible explanation of the unique value of epistemic modals.  One could attempt to provide epistemic modals with a more nuanced semantic content, or couch their apparent additional contribution in terms of general pragmatic principles.] *Attention shifting*, then, is a novel contribution type because it makes use of information in a unique way.  And it, too, is associated with an appropriate response. The appropriate response to such a contribution is to direct ones further contributions to this highlighted piece of the total common ground.^[Additional contribution types may include *suppositions*, which are carried by the antecedents of conditionals.]

These examples do not provide an exhaustive list of distinct contribution types, nor do I suggest that I can provide identity conditions specific to types of contribution. But these examples to share certain things in common, and their common traits can provide us with criteria for recognizing novel contribution types.

First, each of these types anticipates an appropriate response, and places constraints on the form of the response. This suggests the following criterion on genuine contribution types:

Criterion 1
 ~ A genuine contribution type has a natural discourse pair complement.

Second, each type outlined above operates on information in a different way. The currency of inquiry is information, and its value is tied to the ways in which information can be put to use to advance the inquiry toward its goal. 

Criterion 2
 ~ A genuine contribution type implements a unique operation on information.

And last, each of the types above is carried by a conventionalized linguistic tool. If a contribution belongs to a specific type, language will have found a way to implement that type.

Criterion 3
 ~ A genuine contribution type is realized by a conventionalized linguistic tool.

I think that posits constitute a genuine contribution type distinct from the others listed. Posits are similar to assertions in that they seems to provide a proposal of added information, and they are similar to questions in that they seems to present an issue for discussion. They are also similar to suppositions in that they seems to be less than fully committal on the part of the speaker.^[Assertion is generally associated with a commitment that it generates for the speaker.  This commitment involves some evidential relation between the asserter and the information conveyed, though it is controversial just what relation it is. But whatever the relation amounts to, it seems clear that we sometimes offer contributions to discourse that go beyond the evidence we have available. And we do this not just as a means of flouting the rules of discourse, but frequently in order to respect the project of the communicative exchange.] But posits are distinct from each of these, and call for a unique treatment.  That they earn such status is what I hope to show throughout the course of this project.

# Correctible inquiry #

Inquiry is a process whereby individuals can use their independent stores of information to mutually expand their understanding of the world around them.

Discourse need not fulfill the needs of inquiry, and inquiry need not take the form of a discourse.  Still, the two conceps are closely related, and investigation into the form of one can unlock insight into the form of the other.

The tradition of update semantics (kamp and heim, groenendijk and stokhof, van den berg, bittner, and brasovanu) has long maintained that linguistic discourse cannot be appropriately understood as a sequence of independent utterances.  Instead, there are essential, semantic relations between utterances.

The idea that discourse is dynamic is both trivial and novel. Discourse takes place in real time, and a conversation builds as new contributions are added. But it doesn't build as a mere sequence of independent utterances. Instead, later utterances depend on prior ones for their interpretability.

## Modeling inquiry ## 

Inquiry is a goal directed process whereby one or more individuals use the cognitive and empirical resources at their disposal to improve their understanding of the world. Discourse is a linguistic process whereby multiple individuals exchange information. Discourse need not but frequently does implement inquiry, so insight into the nature and structure of one of these processes can inform understanding of the nature and structure of the other process.

I take as my starting point the idea that linguistic discourse, represented primarily by two or more interlocutors engaged in conversation, is a form of multiperson inquiry. Inquiry has both an operative definition and a teleological definition. The purpose of inquiry is to improve one's picture of the world. The process by which one achieves that goal is what is open for investigation here.

When individuals engage in a joint inquiry, they presume to cooperatively exchange information for the purpose of mutually improving their picture of the world. In this sense, inquiry is a teleological concept; it is whatever process brings us to a greater understanding of the world around us. 

What is inquiry
What is discourse
What is collaboration
What is disagreement

It is commonly held by discourse theorists that underlying communicative exchange is a cooperative principle. In order to successfully interpret another speaker we work with them to align our communicative goals. But much discourse seems anything but cooperative. Pinker et al. [-@pinker2008] have suggested that communication is an amalgam of cooperation and conflict; that is, a game in which interlocutors are constantly vying to maintain that their interests are preserved in the end. 

Another apparent sign of the limits of cooperation in discourse is the ubiqitous appearance of disagreement in communication. 

Inquiry and discourse are both processes. Discourse is primarily linguistics and inquiry is primarily epistemic. Thus, they are independent concepts. Still, insights into the structure and nature of one may inform understanding of the nature and structure of the other.

# The discourse contribution of contrastive topic #

Focus is a lingusitic tool whose use serves primarily to *package* information as opposed to providing its own contribution. It distinguishes the elements of the sentence in which it occurs that are new to the discussion from those that have already been introduced, thus showing to the other participants in the discourse how the contribution is intended to fit in with what has preceeded. In this sense, focus has a distinctly *backward looking* function. It depends on, and responds to, previous moves in the conversation. So it makes sense that the most common analyses of focus interpretation asign it a *presuppositional* semantic function. Focus adds a *fellicity condition* to the overall import of a sentence; the sentence is interpretable in situ only if material matching the focus semantic value of the sentence can be found in the previously constructed conversation.

Discourse between individuals who share a language can take a wide variety of forms, but academic study has been primarily concerned with the subclass of discourses that fall under the heading of cooperative communicative exchanges of information.  These discourses involve two or more individuals engaged in a project of achieving a mutual goal (generally, increased mutual knowledge), using eachother's stock of information to increase their own. In this form, discourse implements a jointly undertaken *inquiry*. An inquiry is, in the words of Robert Stalnaker, "the enterprise of forming, testing, and revising beliefs" [-@stalnaker1987 p. ix].

While moves in an inquiry (discourse contributions) can be as varied as the language allows, there is a small set of contribution types derivable from the goals of inqury:

An individual can submit (propose) information to be taken on as mutually accepted.  We call this contribution an *assertion*.

The end point of an inquiry depends in part on its starting point, which is the *issue* that is to be resolved by the process of inquiry. An individual can submit a new issue to the inquiry to be taken on as providing a new goal for the inquiry.  We call this contribution a *question*.

Discourse is a joint endeavor, and each of these contribution types is associated with an appropriate response from the contributor's interlocutors.  A contribution and its response constitute a *discourse pair*. For assertions, the appropriate response is either acceptance or denial of the proposed addition to the common ground. Call this a proposal/acceptance pair.  For questions, acceptance and denial are also important, which indicates that the question provides a genuine addition to the common ground. But the question is distinct from an assertion in that it calls out for an anwser, and the form of the question constrains the set of appropriate answers.  Call this a question/answer pair.

Sometimes added to this list of contribution types is the *command*, which proposes a non-linguistic demand upon a participant in the inquiry. The appropriate response to such a contribution is to make the world such that the demand is met (or to reject the demand itself).

Perhaps unsurprisingly, these contribution types each have an associated linguistic mood. Inquiry is a structured process, in which it is important not only what information is available but also how it is to be put to use in reaching the goal. As an implementation of inquiry, linguistic discourse has conventional means of representing how the information is being put to use by a contribution. But the scope of contribution types is not limited by the set of conventional moods. What is important is that there is a recognizably unique way in which information is put to use to further the goals of the inquiry. 

One motivation for introducing a novel contribution type is by classifying certain linguistic particles as carriers of that type. For instance, a natural model of the semantic value of epistemic modals [@veltman1996, @fintel2010] is that they provide a test of the common ground. If the test is passed the entire common ground passes through unaltered; if the test is failed, the common ground collapses and a repair is required. But if this was all epistemic modals did, their ubiquity in discourse would be mysterious, as their function is reduced to trivial operations on the common ground.  One way of explaining the utility of epistemic modals in discourse is in terms of their unique contribution type. This project has been undertaken within the inquisitive semantics tradition, by accounting for the contribution of epistemic modals as a way of highlighting particular possible worlds within an information state [@groenendijk2014].^[This is, of course, not the only possible explanation of the unique value of epistemic modals.  One could attempt to provide epistemic modals with a more nuanced semantic content, or couch their apparent additional contribution in terms of general pragmatic principles.] *Attention shifting*, then, is a novel contribution type because it makes use of information in a unique way.  And it, too, is associated with an appropriate response. The appropriate response to such a contribution is to direct ones further contributions to this highlighted piece of the total common ground.^[Additional contribution types may include *suppositions*, which are carried by the antecedents of conditionals.]

These examples do not provide an exhaustive list of distinct contribution types, nor do I suggest that I can provide identity conditions specific to types of contribution. But these examples to share certain things in common, and their common traits can provide us with criteria for recognizing novel contribution types.

First, each of these types anticipates an appropriate response, and places constraints on the form of the response. This suggests the following criterion on genuine contribution types:

Criterion 1
 ~ A genuine contribution type has a natural discourse pair complement.

Second, each type outlined above operates on information in a different way. The currency of inquiry is information, and its value is tied to the ways in which information can be put to use to advance the inquiry toward its goal. 

Criterion 2
 ~ A genuine contribution type implements a unique operation on information.

And last, each of the types above is carried by a conventionalized linguistic tool. If a contribution belongs to a specific type, language will have found a way to implement that type.

Criterion 3
 ~ A genuine contribution type is realized by a conventionalized linguistic tool.

I think that posits constitute a genuine contribution type distinct from the others listed. Posits are similar to assertions in that they seems to provide a proposal of added information, and they are similar to questions in that they seems to present an issue for discussion. They are also similar to suppositions in that they seems to be less than fully committal on the part of the speaker.^[Assertion is generally associated with a commitment that it generates for the speaker.  This commitment involves some evidential relation between the asserter and the information conveyed, though it is controversial just what relation it is. But whatever the relation amounts to, it seems clear that we sometimes offer contributions to discourse that go beyond the evidence we have available. And we do this not just as a means of flouting the rules of discourse, but frequently in order to respect the project of the communicative exchange.] But posits are distinct from each of these, and call for a unique treatment.  That they earn such status is what I hope to show throughout the course of this project.

Stalnaker starts off with cases problematic to the possible worlds account of content by describing the way the world intuitively appears to the person with the problematic belief.

In Semantics for Belief, he describes a world much like ours except with a planet different from our Venus appearing as the first planet in the evening sky.

This is supposed to be the world O'Leary thinks he is in when he says ``Hesperus is Mars''.

But it might matter what the larger conversational context within which this utterance is made is like.  He could use ``Hesperus is Mars'' in a situation in which there is only one planet that appears first in the evening and last in the morning, but where the planet that does so is the 4th planet from the sun as opposed to the 2nd.

Discourse between individuals who share a language can take a wide variety of forms, but academic study has been primarily concerned with the subclass of discourses that fall under the heading of cooperative communicative exchanges of information.  These discourses involve two or more individuals engaged in a project of achieving a mutual goal (generally, increased mutual knowledge), using eachother's stock of information to increase their own. In this form, discourse implements a jointly undertaken *inquiry*. An inquiry is, in the words of Robert Stalnaker, "the enterprise of forming, testing, and revising beliefs" [-@stalnaker1987 p. ix].

While moves in an inquiry (discourse contributions) can be as varied as the language allows, there is a small set of contribution types derivable from the goals of inqury:

An individual can submit (propose) information to be taken on as mutually accepted.  We call this contribution an *assertion*.

The end point of an inquiry depends in part on its starting point, which is the *issue* that is to be resolved by the process of inquiry. An individual can submit a new issue to the inquiry to be taken on as providing a new goal for the inquiry.  We call this contribution a *question*.

Discourse is a joint endeavor, and each of these contribution types is associated with an appropriate response from the contributor's interlocutors.  A contribution and its response constitute a *discourse pair*. For assertions, the appropriate response is either acceptance or denial of the proposed addition to the common ground. Call this a proposal/acceptance pair.  For questions, acceptance and denial are also important, which indicates that the question provides a genuine addition to the common ground. But the question is distinct from an assertion in that it calls out for an anwser, and the form of the question constrains the set of appropriate answers.  Call this a question/answer pair.

Sometimes added to this list of contribution types is the *command*, which proposes a non-linguistic demand upon a participant in the inquiry. The appropriate response to such a contribution is to make the world such that the demand is met (or to reject the demand itself).

Perhaps unsurprisingly, these contribution types each have an associated linguistic mood. Inquiry is a structured process, in which it is important not only what information is available but also how it is to be put to use in reaching the goal. As an implementation of inquiry, linguistic discourse has conventional means of representing how the information is being put to use by a contribution. But the scope of contribution types is not limited by the set of conventional moods. What is important is that there is a recognizably unique way in which information is put to use to further the goals of the inquiry. 

One motivation for introducing a novel contribution type is by classifying certain linguistic particles as carriers of that type. For instance, a natural model of the semantic value of epistemic modals [@veltman1996, @fintel2010] is that they provide a test of the common ground. If the test is passed the entire common ground passes through unaltered; if the test is failed, the common ground collapses and a repair is required. But if this was all epistemic modals did, their ubiquity in discourse would be mysterious, as their function is reduced to trivial operations on the common ground.  One way of explaining the utility of epistemic modals in discourse is in terms of their unique contribution type. This project has been undertaken within the inquisitive semantics tradition, by accounting for the contribution of epistemic modals as a way of highlighting particular possible worlds within an information state [@groenendijk] with attention adds another contribution type, which is not to add any new information to the common ground but to call already present information to attention. The appropriate response to such a contribution is to direct ones further contributions to this highlighted piece of the total common ground.^[This is, of course, not the only possible explanation of the unique value of epistemic modals.  One could attempt to provide epistemic modals with a more nuanced semantic content, or couch their apparent additional contribution in terms of general pragmatic principles.]



Additionally, there may be a contribution type of supposition.  
--carried by conditionals
--opposed to the hidden modal/dual context sensitivity models of conditionals
--could a test for contribution type be the presence of an appropriate response condition?
--or might the test be the ability to capture it within the non-content based infrastructure of the model?

I think that there is another contribution type that is distinct from the others listed. It is similar to assertion in that it seems to provide a proposal of added information, and it is similar to a question in that it seems to present an issue for discussion, and it is similar to supposition in that it seems to be less than fully committal. But it is distinct from each of these, and it calls for a unique treatment.  It calls for this treatment in part because it gives rise to an appropriate response condition, and in part because there is a natural postion for it within the non-content based infrastructure of the model of possible world semantics.

Assertion is generally associated with a commitment that it generates for the speaker.  This commitment involves some evidential relation between the asserter and the information conveyed, though it is controversial just what relation it is. But whatever the relation amounts to, it seems clear that we sometimes offer contributions to discourse that go beyond the evidence we have available. And we do this not just as a means of flouting the rules of discourse, but frequently in order to respect the project of the communicative exchange.
--Maybe we have here a concilliatory position between the knowledge normers and the belief normers.  

I call this contribution a posit.  In what follows, I'll explore three motivations for recognizing this type of contribution based on the concept of inquiry.  

Posits call for an appropriate response as well, which is a correction.  And the second paper is an exploration of this discourse pair.

Posits are no ad hoc addendum, as they form a natural position within a standard update semantics.  This is explored in the third paper.

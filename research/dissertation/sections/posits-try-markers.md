try-marker: an attempted reference within an utterance marked to indicate recognition that the heareer may not pick up on the reference, but the speaker doesn't want to derail the conversation to conclusively rectify this potential confusion.
form of try-marker: upward intonational contour followed by brief pause

Try-marker attempts reference without certainty for the purpose of continuting flow of conversation (minimum preference v. recognitional preference)

Posit attempts restriction without certainty for the purpose of advancing the flow of inquiry

Both rely on the role of the interlocutor as corrector.
Would be cool if there was a similar intonation pattern between them.  
--need a recognizable form for posits ( maybe statements preceeding corrections?)
--Think sentence final intonation (there are question raises, assertion flat, and posit raises)

A try-marker is an attempted reference within an utterance marked to indicate recognition that the heareer may not pick up on the reference, but the speaker doesn't want to derail the conversation to conclusively rectify this potential confusion. In English, the general form of try-markers is an upward intonational contour followed by brief pause. When a speaker uses a try-marker, she attempts reference without certainty that the attempt will be successful for the purpose of continuting the flow of conversation.  The general rational motivation for such a mechanism is a preference for minimal effort over security of recognition.

On the semantic side of things, a posit is an attempt to impose a restriction on the context set without certainty regarding the truth of the proposal for the purpose of advancing the flow of inquiry. 

Both try-markers and posits depend for their discursive viability on the role of  interlocutors as correctors. Speakers feel comfortable prefering speed and simplicity over accuracy because they know that a diligent interlocutor will correct them if need be.

# Posit/correction pairs and versioning #

A preference for belief in the face of uncertainty is motivated in part by the fact that not every choice is a matter of life or death.  It is further supported by the fact that inquiries are packaged with corrective feedback mechanisms.  An important such mechanism is the build and test update procedure that inquiry exhibits. Inquiries are cummulatively built in a step by step process. One contributor to the inquiry adds a proposal to the mutual inquiry workspace (akin to the sandbox in comupter program development jargon), at which point it can be played around with by all members of the inquiry before being ultimately accepted or rejected. Thinking of inquiry as involving separate scoreboards and a shared sandbox in addition to the long term storage of the shared scoreboard allows us to capture the more subtle process of inquiry development and update.  I also allows us to incorporate a type of file versioning common to the collaborative computer programming community.  When contributions are in the working memory of the sandbox, they demand little long term cognitive resources.  Anaphoric relations do not span long temporal distances, and the commitments to the consequences of posits within the sandbox are limited. But once tests of the contribution have run their course, the output is entered into longer term storage, and entry into this level of the inquiry record carries stiffer commitments.  Of course, even here the vetting process is fallible, and we may enter falsehoods into the inquiry record. It is further possible that these falsehoods only raise problems at some distance from their original entry into the record. But inquirers have the resources to correct for these failed entries when they are detected.  To explain this capacity, it is helpful to draw an analogy to another tool of the computer program development community, that of file versioning. When one is working on a file for which there are multiple collaborators, it is helpful to have one's own copy, on which changes can be made.  Then the team needs a common file, into which they can enter their changes.  To ensure that conflicting changes do not corrupt the file, we incorporate a system of file versioning, in which each amendment to the file is marked to indicate important facts about the amendments such as the content, time, and author of the amendments. Then in addition to the continuously amended file, we store also this versioning data.  This supplements  the inquiry with a map of its history.  One of the great benefits of this addition is that it allows us to restore the inquiry at any point if it starts to run off the rails.  If a false entry into the record only later reveals itself to be problematic, the inquiry need not be derailed entirely because we can simply revert back to a point in the inquiry prior to the entry of that falsehood using our version history. Inquiries can withstand failures.

These corrective mechanisms are an important reason that efficiency often demands that we make speculative additions to the common ground as opposed to waiting until we can obtain certainty that the addition is true (or otherwise appropriate). But the success of this procedure depends highly on a shared understanding of each party's role in the inquiry. An individual can only feel comfortable in proposing a speculative addition to the common ground if they believe that their collaborators will correct their contribution to the best of their ability.  And this requires interlocutors to be more than passive recipients of information.  They must use openings in the conversation to voice disapproval or uncertainty in addition to registering understanding and acceptance of what has been presented.

Disagreement is the tool by which interlocutors can check each other's flights of fancy.  And, I maintain, it is a tool we both know how to wield, and are prepared to let others weild against us.  The primary role of joint inquiry is to expedite what would be an extremely tedious task if attempted alone.  Even alone, the task can be sped up via judicious application of speculative intellectual leaps, though the risk involved cannot be wholly eliminated.  The collaborative facet of joint inquiry provides extra motivation for assuming the risk -- the cooperative interlocutor, to the extent she is able, will pull you back from the ledge by voicing her disagreement.

## William James and the will to believe ## {#james}

William James famously drew a distinction between two independent and sometimes conflicting goals for those engaged in the pursuit of knowledge.  The first is to acquire true beliefs.  The second is to avoid believing falsehoods.  One could meet the goal of believing truths simply by believing everything, but doing so sacrifices entirely achieving the second goal.  And one could meet the goal of avoiding falsehoods by believing nothing at all, thereby forfeiting the virtue of believing truths. As James saw it, a strategy of inquiry that floats between these extremes is the path we ought to search for.

James admits that the second goal, that of avoiding false belief, seems to carry more sway, especially in the realm of scientific inquiry.  Belief is conceptually tied to action, and while acting on false belief is frought with peril, witholding belief and failing to act due more rarely leads to trouble.  But sometimes non-action is itself action, and peril can find those who remain in one place as well as those who run into its path.  James' project was to characterize the situations in which inquiry optimization favors the goal of truth acquisition, even at the potential expense of error avoidance.  His proposal, famously, was that for situations in which one's belief choice is *live*, *forced*, and *momentous*, the will to believe outstrips the fear of being wrong. Unfortunately, this category leaves out most quotidian inquiries; perhaps some people ponder the existence of God on a daily basis, but most of us are happy just to complete our grocery shopping all in one trip.

So, it's not clear that the Jamesian model applies to inquiry generally.  In so far as the goal of inquiry is ultimately knowledgeable action, it may be better to take the conservative approach of only modifying the shared information state in the presence of certainty. Still, the interpretation of "live", "momentous" and "forced" all depend on the relevant context.  Few, if any, decisions are forced *simpliciter*, but many seem unavoidable given simple background considerations.  I don't *have to* pick up either seitan or tofu from the store, but given certain desires I have -- to get protein without harming too many folks along the way -- I've got to make up my mind before the store closes.  So, one could expand James' proposal to cover certain everyday inquiries simply by taking his criteria to involve restricted quantification over possibilities.

But the adventurous inquirer need not accept context's life preserver.  Even James, the arch supported of faith-based belief, has restricted his spectulative endeavors too far.  Inquiry need not be momentous or forced for a jump to a conclusion to be fruitful.  James' model makes inquiry an optimization task between taking on too many falsehoods and leaving out too many truths.  And it is a task that is undertaken by fallible individuals in real time.  Such agents have limited access to information and limited resources to dedicate to the process of inquiry [@bratman1988]. Frequently, action is required when certainty cannot be obtained. And on many quotidian decision points, the risk of being incorrect is fairly low. It is *because* not every inquiry is momentous that striving for truth (and risking falsehood) is sometimes to be prefered. 

These corrective mechanisms are an important reason that efficiency often demands that we make speculative additions to the common ground as opposed to waiting until we can obtain certainty that the addition is true (or otherwise appropriate). But the success of this procedure depends highly on a shared understanding of each party's role in the inquiry. An individual can only feel comfortable in proposing a speculative addition to the common ground if they believe that their collaborators will correct their contribution to the best of their ability.  And this requires interlocutors to be more than passive recipients of information.  They must use openings in the conversation to voice disapproval or uncertainty in addition to registering understanding and acceptance of what has been presented.

Disagreement is the tool by which interlocutors can check each other's flights of fancy.  And, I maintain, it is a tool we both know how to wield, and are prepared to let others weild against us.  The primary role of joint inquiry is to expedite what would be an extremely tedious task if attempted alone.  Even alone, the task can be sped up via judicious application of speculative intellectual leaps, though the risk involved cannot be wholly eliminated.  The collaborative facet of joint inquiry provides extra motivation for assuming the risk -- the cooperative interlocutor, to the extent she is able, will pull you back from the ledge by voicing her disagreement. 

David Lewis [-@Lewis1975b] spoke of language as a convention of truth and trust in a community.  His idea was that our shared language is supported by a tacit agreement to speak truthfully, and to trust that others will do so as well.  While the Jamesian model accepts the importance of speaking truthfully, it maintains that the convention may sometimes call for speaking rather than remaining silent even when truth cannot be guaranteed.  The importance of trust remains paramount, but it is not just the hearers' trust in the speaker to utter truly.  It is also the speaker's trust in his hearers to correct him when he doesn't.

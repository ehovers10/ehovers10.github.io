### Question/answer congruence ###

The star bit of data that is marshalled in support of this proposal is that of question/answer congruence. Compare the responses to the following question:

(@) Who ate the last cookie?
	- [Caitlin]<sub>f</sub> ate the last cookie.
	- Caitlin ate the last [cookie]<sub>f</sub>

While response B is a perfectly natural answer, the placement of focus in C makes it stand out as unacceptable.  According to a popular analysis of questions, due to Hamblin, the semantic value of a question is the set of propositions that count as answers to it. So, a (suitably contextually constrained) semantic value for question A might be:

(@) {_Albert ate the last cookie_, _Betsy ate the last cookie_, _Caitlin ate the last cookie_, ...}

And, the proposed analysis of focus renders the following focus semantic values for the given responses:

(@) {_Albert ate the last cookie_, _Betsy ate the last cookie_, _Caitlin ate the last cookie_, ...}

(@) {_Caitlin ate the last apple_, _Caitlin ate the last beet_, _Caitlin ate the last cookie_, ...}

The alternative set generated by the focus in B is the same as the semantic value for question A, and that generated by the focus in C is not.  Add in the proposed fellicity condition, and you have a great explanation of question/answer congruence.

Historical perspectives on dispute and collaboration in inquiry

William James

William James famously drew a distinction between two independent and sometimes conflicting goals for those engaged in the pursuit of knowledge.  The first is to acquire true beliefs.  The second is to avoid believing falsehoods.  One could meet the goal of believing truths simply by believing everything, but doing so sacrifices entirely achieving the second goal.  And one could meet the goal of avoiding falsehoods by believing nothing at all, thereby forfeiting the virtue of believing truths. As James saw it, a strategy of inquiry that floats between these extremes is the path we ought to search for.

James admits that the second goal, that of avoiding false belief, seems to carry more sway, especially in the realm of scientific inquiry.  Belief is conceptually tied to action, and while acting on false belief is frought with peril, witholding belief and failing to act due more rarely leads to trouble.  But sometimes non-action is itself action, and peril can find those who remain in one place as well as those who run into its path.  James' project was to characterize the situations in which inquiry optimization favors the goal of truth acquisition, even at the potential expense of error avoidance.  His proposal, famously, was that for situations in which one's belief choice is *live*, *forced*, and *momentous*, the will to believe outstrips the fear of being wrong. Unfortunately, this category leaves out most quotidian inquiries; perhaps some people ponder the existence of God on a daily basis, but most of us are happy just to complete our grocery shopping all in one trip.

So, it's not clear that the Jamesian model applies to inquiry generally.  In so far as the goal of inquiry is ultimately knowledgeable action, it may be better to take the conservative approach of only modifying the shared information state in the presence of certainty. Still, the interpretation of ``live'', ``momentous'' and ``forced'' all depend on the relevant context.  Few, if any, decisions are forced *simpliciter*, but many seem unavoidable given simple background considerations.  I don't *have to* pick up either seitan or tofu from the store, but given certain desires I have -- to get protein without harming too many folks along the way -- I've got to make up my mind before the store closes.  So, one could expand James' proposal to cover certain everyday inquiries simply by taking his criteria to involve restricted quantification over possibilities.

But the adventurous inquirer need not accept context's life preserver.  Even James, the arch supported of faith-based belief, has restricted his spectulative endeavors too far.  Inquiry need not be momentous or forced for a jump to a conclusion to be fruitful.  James' model makes inquiry an optimization task between taking on too many falsehoods and leaving out too many truths.  And it is a task that is undertaken by fallible individuals in real time.  Such agents have limited access to information and limited resources to dedicate to the process of inquiry. (CITE Bratman) Frequently, action is required when certainty cannot be obtained. And on many quotidian decision points, the risk of being incorrect is fairly low. It is *because* not every inquiry is momentous that striving for truth (and risking falsehood) is sometimes to be prefered.   

A preference for belief in the face of uncertainty is motivated in part by th fact that not every choice is a matter of life or death.  It is further supported by the fact that inquiries are packaged with corrective feedback mechanisms.  An important such mechanism is the build and test update procedure that inquiry exhibits. Inquiries are cummulatively built in a step by step process. One contributor to the inquiry adds a proposal to the mutual inquiry workspace (akin to the sandbox in comupter program development jargon), at which point it can be played around with by all members of the inquiry before being ultimately accepted or rejected. Thinking of inquiry as involving separate scoreboards and a shared sandbox in addition to the long term storage of the shared scoreboard allows us to capture the more subtle process of inquiry development and update.  I also allows us to incorporate a type of file versioning common to the collaborative computer programming community.  When contributions are in the working memory of the sandbox, they demand little long term cognitive resources.  Anaphoric relations do not span long temporal distances, and the commitments to the consequences of posits within the sandbox are limited. But once tests of the contribution have run their course, the output is entered into longer term storage, and entry into this level of the inquiry record carries stiffer commitments.  Of course, even here the vetting process is fallible, and we may enter falsehoods into the inquiry record. It is further possible that these falsehoods only raise problems at some distance from their original entry into the record. But inquirers have the resources to correct for these failed entries when they are detected.  To explain this capacity, it is helpful to draw an analogy to another tool of the computer program development community, that of file versioning. When one is working on a file for which there are multiple collaborators, it is helpful to have one's own copy, on which changes can be made.  Then the team needs a common file, into which they can enter their changes.  To ensure that conflicting changes do not corrupt the file, we incorporate a system of file versioning, in which each amendment to the file is marked to indicate important facts about the amendments such as the content, time, and author of the amendments. Then in addition to the continuously amended file, we store also this versioning data.  This supplements  the inquiry with a map of its history.  One of the great benefits of this addition is that it allows us to restore the inquiry at any point if it starts to run off the rails.  If a false entry into the record only later reveals itself to be problematic, the inquiry need not be derailed entirely because we can simply revert back to a point in the inquiry prior to the entry of that falsehood using our version history. Inquiries can withstand failures.

These corrective mechanisms are an important reason that efficiency often demands that we make speculative additions to the common ground as opposed to waiting until we can obtain certainty that the addition is true (or otherwise appropriate). But the success of this procedure depends highly on a shared understanding of each parties role in the inquiry.

Disagreement is the tool by which interlocutors can check each other's flights of fancy.  And, I maintain, it is a tool we both know how to wield, and are prepared to let others weild against us.  The primary role of joint inquiry is to expedite what would be an extremely tedious task if attempted alone.  Even alone, the task can be sped up via judicious application of speculative intellectual leaps; though the risk involved cannot be wholly eliminated.  The collaborative facet of joint inquiry provides extra motivation for assuming the risk -- the cooperative interlocutor, to the extent she is able, will pull you back from the ledge by voicing her disagreement. 

David Lewis spoke of language as a convention of truth and trust in a community.  His idea was that our shared language is supported by a tacit agreement to speak truthfully, and to trust that others will do so as well.  While the Jamesian accepts the importance of speaking truthfully, she maintains that the convention may sometimes call for speaking rather than remaining silent even when truth cannot be guaranteed.  The importance of trust remains paramount, but it is not just the hearers' trust in the speaker to utter truly.  It is also the speaker's trust in his hearer's to correct him when he doesn't.

J. S. Mill

John Stuart Mill's defense of liberty similarly centrally relies on dispute. Even in the face of certainty regarding the answer to certain questions, dispute plays an important role. To be always ready to dispute opponents' claims keeps one's defense of their own claims fresh.

Again, joint inquiry incorporates the same insights. To make advances, inquirers must take some things as granted. But rigidity halts discussion, and cooperative interlocutors can't merely assert; they must be able to respond to critique of those assertions as well.

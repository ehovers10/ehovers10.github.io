Whatever stance we take on the outcome of this debate, and I will have more to say about the issue later on, disagreement does seem to be a valuable tool to have in the linguist's toolkit.  Language users have intuitions about the compatibility of sentences used in discourse, and linguistic theories ought to respect those intutions.

But simply marking the presence of incompatible contents in a discourse is a relatively peripheral role for disagreement to play in lingusitic theorizing. As they stand, the semantic theories considered above give no insight into disputative discourse itself; they merely accord to a greater or lesser extent with one interesting consequence of such discourse. 

Disputative discourse, though, is pervasive, and it would be valuable to have an account that makes sense of the broader role that it plays in the project of cooperative comminicative exchange generally. Throughout the course of this work, I hope to shed some light on this role.  I will indicate what I take the role of disputative discourse to be, provide a model in the update semantic tradition for how to understand (at least one important subclass of) disputative discourse, and apply this model to two active debates within the philosophy of language.

	<h4>09/14/2014 </h4>

	<p><p>As in many sports, baseball coaches attempt to combine education and inspiration by way of adages intended to distill complex strategy into a simple phrase.  Among the stalwarts of this tradition are <em>run out every ball put in play</em> and <em>on a ball hit in the air, make your first step be backwards</em>.  The axiom I&#39;d like to focus on today is:</p>

	<h2><a href="/2014/09/12/jamesian-inquiry.html">Jamesian inquiry</a></h2>
	<h4>09/12/2014  | <a href="">inquiry</a>  | <a href="">disagreement</a>  | <a href="">william james</a> </h4>

	<p><p>William James famously drew a distinction between two independent and sometimes conflicting goals for those engaged in the pursuit of knowledge.  The first is to acquire true beliefs.  The second is to avoid believing falsehoods.  One could meet the goal of believing truths simply by believing everything, but doing so sacrifices entirely the second goal.  And one could meet the goal of avoiding falsehoods by believing nothing at all, thereby forfeiting the virtue of believing truths. As James saw it, a strategy of inquiry that floats between these extremes is the path we ought to search for.</p>

	<h4>09/11/2014  | <a href="">semantics</a>  | <a href="">contextualism</a>  | <a href="">relativism</a>  | <a href="">shared content</a> </h4>

	<p><p>On one way of understanding the conceptual terrain, <em>contextualism</em> and <em>relativism</em> differ on which context is relevant to the assessment of a contribution to the discourse.  In normal communicative exchanges, there are two salient contexts whose features can plausibly impact interpretation-- the context of the speaker and the context of the audience. And in normal communicative exchanges, there will be considerable overlap between these contexts.  However, certain differences can develop, and the choice of which context to feed to the semantic machinery can make a difference to the interpretation of contributions to the discourse.</p>

	<h4>09/10/2014  | <a href="">semantics</a>  | <a href="">correctibles</a>  | <a href="">generics</a> </h4>

	<p><p>I&#39;ve been thinking a lot lately about a class of expression that I&#39;m calling &quot;correctibles&quot;.  The idea behind these expressions (or perhaps better, use of expressions) is that they exhibit a certain resiliance to correction.  For instance, I think that generics and certain relative expressions are in this class.</p>

		<h2>about me</h2>
	
		<img src="/images/loomis.jpg" alt="" title="contemplating update semantics at an undisclosed location">

		<p>I am a graduate student in the philosophy department at <a href="http://philosophy.rutgers.edu/" title="ru philosophy">Rutgers University</a>. Before making my way out to Jersey, I received my bachelor's and master's degrees in philosophy from the <a href="http://www.uwyo.edu/philosophy/" title="uw philosophy">University of Wyoming</a>.</p>
		
		<h2>about this site</h2>
		
		<p>On this site, you will (soon) find links to some of <a href="/research/" title="erik's research">my philosophical work</a>, which is focused on investigating formal models of the influence of context on natural language interpretation.  In addition, if you are looking for information for one of <a href="/teaching/" title="erik's courses">my classes</a>, you can access resources relevant to the course. I've also started <a href="/blog/" title="erik's blog">blogging</a> a little bit. Right now, the output is mostly notes on or small snippets from my dissertation.</p>

Intuitively, despite having a point of genuine conflict between them, neither party to the disagreement is incorrect in their assertion. I pull out criteria that an adequate proposal for the semantics of predicates of personal taste must meet. While relativism is an adequate proposal, I argue that a contextualist proposal can also account for our intuitions. The key insight is that disagreement can be carried by pragmatic features of utterances, even if there is no semantic conflict.<br></div></div><div class="element"><span class="start">Outstanding Masters Thesis Award</span>, University of Wyoming School of Arts &amp; Sciences (May 2008)<br></div></div><div class="element"><span class="start">BA in Philosophy</span>, <ul class="short"><li>magna cum laude</li></ul>, University of Wyoming (December 2005)</div></div></div><div class="section projects"><h2>projects</h2><h4>digital development</h4><div class="body"><div class="element"><a class="start" href="http://wyocraftbrewersguild.com">Wyo Craft Brewers Guild Website</a>, Wyoming Craft Brewers Guild (April 2019)<br><div class="details">A simple WordPress site for a nonprofit organization located in Sheridan, WY.

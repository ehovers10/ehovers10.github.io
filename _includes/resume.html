Intuitively, these discourses involve faultless disagreement; despite having a point of genuine conflict between them, neither party is incorrect in their assertion. I pull out a number of criteria that an adequate proposal for the semantics of predicates of personal taste must meet. While relativism offers one adequate proposal, I argue that a contextualist proposal can also adequately account for our intuitions. The key instight is that disagreement can be carried by pragmatic features of utterances, even if there is no semantic conflict.<br></div></div></div></div><div class="section teaching"><h2 class="title">teaching</h2><div class="body"><div class="element"><span class="start">Introduction to Philosophy</span>, Montclair State University (Fall 2015) <span class="listhead"></span>[<ul class="sub"><li><a class="link" href="http://erikhoversten.org/phil-intro/">Course Materials</a></li></ul>]</div><div class="element"><span class="start">Introduction to Logic</span>, Rutgers University (Spring 2015) <span class="listhead"></span>[<ul class="sub"><li><a class="link" href="http://erikhoversten.org/intro-logic/">Course Materials</a></li></ul>]</div><div class="element"><span class="start">Logic, reason, and persuasion</span>, Rutgers University (Fall 2014) <span class="listhead"></span>[<ul class="sub"><li><a class="link" href="http://www.erikhoversten.org/teaching/ru101f14-syllabus.pdf">Syllabus</a></li><li><a class="link" href="http://erikhoversten.org/teaching/ru101-f14/">Lectures</a></li></ul>]</div><div class="element"><span class="start">Introduction to ethics</span>, Rutgers University (Spring 2014) <span class="listhead"></span>[<ul class="sub"><li><a class="link" href="http://www.erikhoversten.org/teaching/ru107s14-syllabus.pdf">Syllabus</a></li><li><a class="link" href="http://www.erikhoversten.org/teaching/ru107s14-assessment.pdf">Assessment</a></li><li><a class="link" href="http://www.erikhoversten.org/teaching/intro-ethics-s14/index.html">Course Materials</a></li></ul>]</div><div class="element"><span class="start">Current moral and social issues</span>, Rutgers University (Fall 2013) <span class="listhead"></span>[<ul class="sub"><li><a class="link" href="http://www.erikhoversten.org/teaching/ru105f13-syllabus.pdf">Syllabus</a></li><li><a class="link" href="http://www.erikhoversten.org/teaching/ru105f13-assessment.pdf">Assessment</a></li></ul>]</div><div class="element"><span class="start">Introduction to Philosophy</span>, Rutgers University (Fall 2011,Spring 2012) <span class="listhead"></span>[<ul class="sub"><li><a class="link" href="http://www.erikhoversten.org/teaching/ru103s12-syllabus.pdf">Syllabus</a></li><li><a class="link" href="http://www.erikhoversten.org/teaching/ru103s12-assessment.pdf">Assessment</a></li></ul>]</div></div></div></div></div></div>

<p>I grew up in Wyoming at the foot of the Big Horn Mountains. Exploring those peaks provided unending opportunity for contemplation and deep concern for natural environments.</p>
<p>I studied philosophy at the University of Wyoming and Rutgers University, taking away a Master's degree from each institution. My research iterests were in the philosophy of language and logic. I'm principally intrigued by the project of studying natural language discourse as a means of limning cognitive structure. I think of conversation as a collaborative inquiry, which is to say that successful contribution to the discourse requires the efforts of multiple parties working in concert, not just serially. I've put together an (as yet incomplete) project exploring this idea, which I call <a href="http://dci.erikhoversten.org">Collaborative Discourse Dynamics</a>.</p>
<p>I worked for the <a href="https://bigreuse.org/compost/">NYC Compost Project hosted by Big Reuse</a> from 2015 to 2018. The public/private joint venture works to educate NYC residents about the virtues of composting, divert organic waste from landfills, and improve city soil. As an Operations Coordinator, I was the principal operator of the Salt Lot Compost Site in Gowanus, Brooklyn where we processed over 5000 pounds of food scraps every week and worked with the <a href="http://gowanuscanalconservancy.org/">Gowanus Canal Conservancy</a> to use our finished compost to improve neighborhood soils.</p>
<p>Currently, I am back in Sheridan, WY with my wife, Caitlin. I do website development for nonprofits and help them build a complete web presence by integrating their operations with web applications for customer maintenace and ecommerce. Some of my projects include <a href="https://bigreuse.org">Big Reuse</a> and <a href="http://wyocraftbrewersguild.com">Wyoming Craft Brewers Guild</a>. I also design and manufacture lamps. My style has a touch of the steam-punk, and I like to incorporate my philosophical background into the inspiration for each piece. You can check out some of my work (and even order a llamp of your own) at <a href="http://lettherebe.lighting">lettherebe.lighting</a>.</p>

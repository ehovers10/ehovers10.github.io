<p>I grew up in Wyoming at the foot of the Big Horn Mountains. Exploring those peaks provided unending opportunity for contemplation and deep concern for natural environments.</p>
<p>I studied philosophy at the University of Wyoming and Rutgers University, taking away a Master's degree from each institution. My research iterests were in the philosophy of language and logic. I'm principally intrigued by the project of studying natural language discourse as a means of limning cognitive structure. I think of conversation as a collaborative inquiry, which is to say that successful contribution to the discourse requires the efforts of multiple parties working in concert, not just serially. I've put together an (as yet incomplete) project exploring this idea, which I call <a href="http://dci.erikhoversten.org">Collaborative Discourse Dynamics</a>.</p>
<p>Currently, I work for the <a href="http://bigreuse.org/compost/">NYC Compost Project hosted by Big Reuse</a>. We are a public/private joint venture that works to educate NYC residents about the virtues of composting, divert organic waste from landfills, and improve city soil. As an Operations Coordinator, I am the principal operator at our Salt Lot Compost Site in Gowanus, Brooklyn. We process over 5000 pounds of food scraps every week and work with the <a href="http://gowanuscanalconservancy.org/">Gowanus Canal Conservancy</a> to use our finished compost to improve the neighborhood soils.</p>

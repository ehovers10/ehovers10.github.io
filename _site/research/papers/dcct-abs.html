	<p>The standard way of analyzing focus interpreation involves three components.  The focus imposes a structure on the sentence, dividing the semantic subject (focus) from the semantic predicate (topic).  The focus additionally determines a focus semantic value, an alternative set derived from abstracting over the focus and applying the topic to all elements of the domain of the same type as the focus.  Finally, there is a fellicity condition associated with the focus.  The sentence is interpretable only if prior discourse provides a semantic value that is identical to the (properly contextually constrained) focus semantic value.</p>

<p>Interestingly, focus does not always neatly divide the informational structure of a sentence into the already given topic material and the newly contributed focus material. The intonational stress indicative of focus can also appear within the semantic predicate.  In this occurrence, the focus is labeled <em>contrastive topic</em>. While there are distinctive differences in tone, contrastive topic appears to be serving a similar function as focus generally, and it would be nice to subsume it under the same interpretational schema. While greatly successful, his proposal presented above appears to run into trouble when applied to contrastive topic.</p>

<p>The primary issue is that in clearly fellicitous uses of contrastive topic, the fellicity condition mentioned above need not be met.  That is, the alternative set that would be generated by the element focused by contrastive topic need not have an explicit conversational antecedent.</p>

<p>But no <em>explicit</em> antecendent does not mean no antecedent whatsoever. Building off of Craige Roberts’ notion of the <em>question under discussion</em>, which posits the presence of merely implicit, or accommodated, questions on the conversational scoreboard, Daniel B"{u}ring has suggested that contrastive topic be understood as presupposing a subquestion of the primary question under discussion.  The structured set of questions and subquestions constitutes a plan of inquiry for the conversation.  The upshot is that a sentence involving contrastive topic is fellicitously uttered only if it provides a complete answer to a subquestion within the plan of inquiry for the conversation underway.</p>

<p>The fruitfullness of the question under discussion paradigm for the conversational scoreboard certainly provides B"{u}ring’s enrichment with a firm precedent.  But it is not without its challenges.  I will examine three such challenges, one theoretical, one conceptual, and the last empirical.</p>

<p>The theoretical issue has to do with the proposal’s reliance on implicit (or accommodated) antecedents for the contrastive topic to reference.  Much of interpretive import takes place below the surface structure of our utterances.  But language interpreters are merely human, and robust interpretive effects ought to be signaled in some way and subsumed under sufficiently constrained rules.  While it may ultimately be within the power of the QUD framework to provide these constrained rules, the mere appeal to accommodation feels theoretically suspect.</p>

<p>The conceptual issue is itself somewhat handwavey, but directing our attention to it provides us with an avenue for pursuing alternative.</p>

try-marker: an attempted reference within an utterance marked to indicate recognition that the heareer may not pick up on the reference, but the speaker doesn't want to derail the conversation to conclusively rectify this potential confusion.
form of try-marker: upward intonational contour followed by brief pause

Try-marker attempts reference without certainty for the purpose of continuting flow of conversation (minimum preference v. recognitional preference)

Posit attempts restriction without certainty for the purpose of advancing the flow of inquiry

Both rely on the role of the interlocutor as corrector.
Would be cool if there was a similar intonation pattern between them.  
--need a recognizable form for posits ( maybe statements preceeding corrections?)
--Think sentence final intonation (there are question raises, assertion flat, and posit raises)

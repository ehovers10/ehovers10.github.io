	<h2 id="focus-as-anaphora-and-questionanswer-congruence">Focus as anaphora and question/answer congruence</h2>

<p>The standard picture of focus interpretation has it that the focused element of a sentence is associated with a focus semantic value, which is a set of alternatives to the focused element.  This alternative set is constrained by the domain of discourse, the semantic type of the focused element, and context.</p>

<p>Focus is additionally assumed to be associated with a fellicity condition: an utterance involving focus is fellicitous just in case the (suitably constrained) alternative set has an equivalent antecedent in the conversation.</p>

<p>The star bit of data that is marshalled in support of this proposal is that of question/answer congruence. Compare the responses to the following question:</p>

<p>(@) Who ate the last cookie?
	- [Caitlin]<sub>f</sub> ate the last cookie.
	- Caitlin ate the last [cookie]<sub>f</sub></p>

<p>While response B is a perfectly natural answer, the placement of focus in C makes it stand out as unacceptable.  According to a popular analysis of questions, due to Hamblin, the semantic value of a question is the set of propositions that count as answers to it. So, a (suitably contextually constrained) semantic value for question A might be:</p>

<p>(@) {<em>Albert ate the last cookie</em>, <em>Betsy ate the last cookie</em>, <em>Caitlin ate the last cookie</em>, …}</p>

<p>And, the proposed analysis of focus renders the following focus semantic values for the given responses:</p>

<p>(@) {<em>Albert ate the last cookie</em>, <em>Betsy ate the last cookie</em>, <em>Caitlin ate the last cookie</em>, …}</p>

<p>(@) {<em>Caitlin ate the last apple</em>, <em>Caitlin ate the last beet</em>, <em>Caitlin ate the last cookie</em>, …}</p>

<p>The alternative set generated by the focus in B is the same as the semantic value for question A, and that generated by the focus in C is not.  Add in the proposed fellicity condition, and you have a great explanation of question/answer congruence.</p>

<p>Analyzing focus interpretation in terms of a pragmatic rule connecting focus semantic values to semantic antecedents in prior discourse is incredibly fruitful. But now consider the following example:</p>

<p>(@) - What did people bring to the picinic?
    - The [children]~cf~ brought [unbridled enthusiasm]~f~.</p>

<p>This response involves two focused elements. For both elements, it is easy enough to generate the requisite alternative sets, and alternative set generated for the second focused element (marked with a subscripted <em>f</em>), is perfectly congruent with the preceding question. But a difficulty arises when we attempt to apply the fellicity condition to the element labeled with <em>cf</em> (for <em>contrastive focus</em>). Its alternative set is distinctly not congruent with the preceding question, so we would expect the entire utterance to be marked as infellicitous.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem-of-contrastive-focus">The problem of contrastive focus</h2>

<p>But now consider the following discourse:</p>

<p>(@bears) - Bears are dangerous.
	 - [Grizzly]~cf~ bears are dangerous.</p>

<p>The response in the example above exhibits what is often called contrastive focus.  While there are some differences in the intonational patters between the focus mentioned earlier and contrastive focus (cf. Gundel), there is reason to think that much the same mechanism is at work in the interpretational effects of both.  But this example poses a challenge for the proposed analysis of focus interpretation.  There is no trouble generating an alternative set for the focused element.  The issue is that there is no explicit antecedent for the generated set.</p>

<p>Daniel Buring has supplied us with a technique to locate the requisite antecedent.  Building on the notion of the question under discussion developed by Cragie Roberts, Buring posits the existence of a discourse tree, which provides structure for the inquiry being undertaken. Each question governing the inqury is a node in the tree and is associated with an array of subquestions, complete answers to which constitute partial answers to the parent question.  The idea is that the subquestions provide a <em>plan of inquiry</em> for addressing the parent question. The objective of the inquiry is to answer the top-most question in the tree. The plan for doing so is to answer each of the subquestions in turn.</p>

<p>But how should we apply this porposal to the current case, where contrastive focus is present without any explicit question? We can, of course, appeal again to the ever present implicit question under discussion. All discourses, it would be maintained, whether questions have been explicitly introduced or not, are governed by a plan of inquiry, which is structured by questions, implicit if need be. Then, the explanation of the contrastive topic in (@bears) would be that the original assertion offers an answer to a parent question, and the correction that follows rejects this answer, replacing it with an answer to a subquestion.</p>

<p>This proposal certainly fits with the structure of the question under discussion representation of the conversational scoreboard. But we may be left a little unsatisfied with the details.  First, it seems to be straining the notion of presupposition pretty heavily. Not only is there no direct representation to stand as antecedent to the generated focus semantic value, [AS WAS POINTED OUT EARLIER] contrastive topic is quite resiliant to infellicity.  Many different potential elements could have been fellicitously focused, and it’s hard to see how the conversational scoreboard could have all of these options ready to hand. The common response to this sort of worry is to appeal to accommodation. If the scoreboard does not contain the d-tree needed to provide the antecedent for the contrastive focus, then straightaway it comes about. This reliance on accommodation is not without its own set of issues, predominantly stemming from the unconstrained character of accommodation as a theoretical posit.</p>

<p>But what I take to be the central issue with this sort of approach to the problem of contrastive topic in corrections is a conceptual one having to do with the role of corrections in discourse evolution. The question under discussion model of contrastive topic makes the discourse contribution of contrastive topic entirely backward looking. Whatever role the focus plays is just a matter of checking prior discourse for an antecedent to the focus generated alternative set. </p>

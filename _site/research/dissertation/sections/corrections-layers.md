## Layers of content ##

Standardly asserted content commits the asserter in a very specific way.  The asserter of content p cannot back off of defending that content in the face of opposition without thereby retracting the assertion.

But not all declarative sentences used by speakers in normal discourse have this effect. Consider, for instance the following exchange. Setting the scene, A and B are discussing how to allot their shared fear resources:

A. Bears are dangerous.
B. [Grizzly] bears are dangerous.
B. Pooh wouldn't hurt a fly!
A. Yeah, but still.

The "yeah, but still" response indicates the speaker's suggestion that her original statement can absorb the attack and still move forward. This phenomenon of non-defeated, challenged assertion (call it a "corrected" assertion) deserves analysis, and I think I've got an interesting suggestion.

There's an easy way in which assertions can be corrected. We say quite a lot when we make a single utterance. Grice recognized that there was reason to distinguish a level fo semantic content from mere implicated content. My tone of voice can add an extra layer of meaning.  ETC ETC.  And all of these layers give me elements of plausible deniability in the situation in which I'm challenged. But if we peel off one layer, we're still left with the other coats I slapped on with my utterance. 

But retrenchment isn't just a matter of sloughing off a tarnished layer.

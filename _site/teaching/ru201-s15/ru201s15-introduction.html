We will explore general logical notions such as <em>truth</em>, <em>validity</em>, and <em>soundness</em> in a rigorous and <em>formal</em> way.</p> <p>Logic is <em>topic neutral</em>.</p> <ul> <li>The idea here is that the principles of logic we are looking at are very general, and apply no matter what specific topic (such as politics, physics, or TV shows) we are discussing.</li> <li>Thus, there is a high reliance on <em>abstraction</em>, and we use <em>symbols</em> to stand in for specific nouns and verbs in our logical sentences.</li> <li>So, much of what we do will look a lot like what you might see in a math class, specifically <em>algebra</em>.</li> </ul> <p>We will introduce a couple specific <em>logical systems</em>, define <em>rules</em> that govern those systems, and use the rules to construct <em>proofs</em> of various <em>theorems</em> within the system.</p> <h2 id="assessment">Assessment</h2> <hr /> <p>Assignment Due date and time Point value ————– ——————— ————— Homework Various (see schedule) 5 @ 20pts = 100pts</p> <p>Midterm exam 1 Feb 18 in class 100pts</p> <p>Midterm exam 2 Apr 1 in class 100pts</p> <p>Final exam May 8, 4-7p (sect. 03) 100pts May 13, 12-3p (sect. 06)</p> <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>                                        Total: 400pts ------------------------------------------------------

But their main function is to help us explain what makes for good and bad <strong>reasoning</strong>.</li> <li>The primary tool of reasoning is the <strong>argument</strong>. Arugments involve: <ul> <li>Premises: one or more sentences used as the foundation of the reasoning.</li> <li>Conclusion: a sentence that is the end point of the reasoning.</li> <li>Support relation: the explanation of how the premises <em>lead to</em> the conclusion.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Thus, we also need our language to define <em>relations between sentences</em> to explain how good arguments work.</li> <li>Using the components we defined earlier, we can do just that: <ul> <li>Syntactic relations: ways to <em>transform</em> one sentence into another one.</li> <li>Semantic properties of sentences: <em>tautology</em>, <em>contradiction</em></li> <li>Semantic relations between sentences: <em>equivalence</em>, <em>consequence</em></li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h1 id="the-language-of-fol">The language of FOL</h1> <ul> <li>Our textbook introduces us to the language of <em>first order logic</em>, or <strong>FOL</strong>.</li> </ul> <div style="clear: right;"></div> </div> <!-- Signature --> <div id="footer"> <p>ehovers10@gmail.com</p> </div> <div style="clear: both;"></div> </body> </html> </div>

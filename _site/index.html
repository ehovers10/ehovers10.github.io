Exploring those peaks provided unending opportunity for contemplation and deep concern for natural environments.</p> <p>I studied philosophy at the University of Wyoming and Rutgers University, taking away a Master's degree from each institution. My research iterests were in the philosophy of language and logic. I'm principally intrigued by the project of studying natural language discourse as a means of limning cognitive structure. I think of conversation as a collaborative inquiry, which is to say that successful contribution to the discourse requires the efforts of multiple parties working in concert, not just serially. I've put together an (as yet incomplete) project exploring this idea, which I call <a href="http://dci.erikhoversten.org">Collaborative Discourse Dynamics</a>.</p> <p>I worked for the <a href="https://bigreuse.org/compost/">NYC Compost Project hosted by Big Reuse</a> from 2015 to 2018. The public/private joint venture works to educate NYC residents about the virtues of composting, divert organic waste from landfills, and improve city soil. As an Operations Coordinator, I was the principal operator of the Salt Lot Compost Site in Gowanus, Brooklyn where we processed over 5000 pounds of food scraps every week and worked with the <a href="http://gowanuscanalconservancy.org/">Gowanus Canal Conservancy</a> to use our finished compost to improve neighborhood soils.</p> <p>Currently, I am back in Sheridan, WY with my wife, Caitlin. I do website development for nonprofits and help them build a complete web presence by integrating their operations with web applications for customer maintenace and ecommerce. Some of my projects include <a href="https://bigreuse.org">Big Reuse</a> and <a href="http://wyocraftbrewersguild.com">Wyoming Craft Brewers Guild</a>. I also design and manufacture lamps. My style has a touch of the steam-punk, and I like to incorporate my philosophical background into the inspiration for each piece. You can check out some of my work (and even order a llamp of your own) at <a href="http://lettherebe.lighting">lettherebe.lighting</a>.</p> </div> <div id="philosophy-hid" class="area philosophy hid"> <h2>major projects</h2><a name="papers"></a> <ul> <li id="title_do">Discourse as collaborative inquiry (<a href="http://dci.erikhoversten.org">html</a>) (<a href="#" id="dciabs" class="open">abstract</a>) <div id="dciabs-hid" class="hid">This project explores the importance of speculation and dispute in inquiry. I contend that conversation commonly realizes a collaborative inquiry, which is to say that successful contribution to the discourse requires the efforts of multiple parties working in concert, not just serially. The goal of the project is to explain, motivate, and provide a model of implementation for this idea, what I call collaborative discourse dynamics. A notable feature of the model is that it gives <em>conjectures</em> pride of place alongside conversational moves such as <em>assertions</em> and <em>questions</em>.</div></li> <li>Disagreement in Context (<a href="/research/disagreement-context-full.pdf">pdf</a>) (<a href="#" id="mauwabs" class="open">abstract</a>) <div id="mauwabs-hid" class="hid">Semantic relativism is the thesis that propositions possess a truth value only relative to some non-standard parameter of evaluation such as times, standards, or judges. In this essay, I examine the evidence for judge-relativism provided by discourses involving disagreement over matters of taste. Intuitively, these discourses involve faultless disagreement despite having a point of genuine conflict between them, both parties involved make correct assertions. An analysis of the semantic significance of these discourses reveals a number of criteria that an adequate proposal for the semantics of predicates of personal taste must meet. While relativism offers one adequate proposal, I argue that the semantic contextualist can also adequately account for the intuitions elicited by these discourses. According to the contextualist, the disputants semantically express true propositions that do not conflict. Their disagreement, however, stems from conflicting commitments that arise from certain pragmatic effects of their utterances in the conversation. </div></li> </ul> <h2>research tools</h2><a name="biblio"></a> <ul> <li>General philosophy of language (<a href="/research/bibliography/philosophy-of-language/">bibliography</a>)</li> <li>David Lewis (<a href="/research/bibliography/david-lewis/">bibliography</a>)</li> <li>Ontic vagueness (<a href="/research/bibliography/ontic-vagueness/">bibliography</a>)</li> <li>Logic markup (<a href="/research/tools/logic.html">tools</a>)</li> </ul> <h2>coursed taught</h2> <ul><li>Philosophy department, Montclair State University</li> <ul> <li><a href="/phil-intro/">Introduction to philosophy, fall 2015</a></li> </ul> <li>Philosophy department, Rutgers University</li> <ul> <li><a href="/intro-logic/">Introduction to logic, spring 2015</a> (<a href="/teaching/ru201-s15/syllabus.pdf">syllabus</a>)</li> <li><a href="/teaching/ru101-f14/">Logic, reason, and persuassion, fall 2014</a> (<a href="/teaching/ru101f14-syllabus.pdf">syllabus</a>, <a href="/teaching/syllabus101f14.html">html syllabus</a>)</li> <li><a href="/teaching/ru107-s14/">Introduction to ethics, spring 2014</a> (<a href="/teaching/ru107s14-syllabus.pdf">syllabus</a>, <a href="/teaching/ru107s14-assessment.pdf">assessment</a>)</li> <li>Current moral and social issues, fall 2013 (<a href="/teaching/ru105f13-syllabus.pdf">syllabus</a>, <a href="/teaching/ru105f13-assessment.pdf">assessment</a>)</li> <li>Introduction to philosophy, spring 2012 (<a href="/teaching/ru103s12-syllabus.pdf">syllabus</a>, <a href="/teaching/ru103s12-assessment.pdf">assessment</a>)</li> <li>Introduction to philosophy, fall 2011 (<a href="/teaching/ru103f11-syllabus.pdf">syllabus</a>, <a href="/teaching/ru103f11-schedule.pdf">schedule</a>)</li> </ul> </ul> </div> <div id="physicalia-hid" class="area physicalia hid"> <h2><a href="http://mountaincompost.com/">Mountain Compost</a></h2> <p>A website dedicated to community-scale composting and geared specifically to mountain environments.

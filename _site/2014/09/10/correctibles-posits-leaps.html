The idea behind these expressions (or perhaps better, use of expressions) is that they exhibit a certain resiliance to correction. For instance, I think that generics and certain relative expressions are in this class.</p> <p>If I say “Cows give milk”, and you challenge me with “What about bulls?”, it may not be out of line for me to respond, “I didn’t say all cows!” Your challenge has force, but my original contribution can sail through at least mostly intact. Similarly, if you say “I know that my car is parked out back”, and I challenge you to prove you aren’t a brain in a vat, you could probably retort, “I didn’t say I could convince a skeptic!”</p> <p>Assuming there’s a genuine linguistic phenomenon here and that a uniform class of (use of) expressions can be determined, I think these correctibles can give us some interesting insight into discourse dynamics. The idea is that correctibles have a corrective potential built into their semantic contribution. Speakers may choose to use a correctible knowing that they may be challenged on it. And the impact of its use may depend on whether a challenge arises. Thus, correctibles provide a nice example of the collaborative effort of discourse development. The nature of my contribution can depend on how you choose to make use of it.</p> <p>The collaborative nature of the communicative exchange seems pretty obvious, but the particularly disputative aspect of corrective communication has some cool motivations. Two of my favorites are John Stuart Mill’s approach to disagreement, and William James’ notion of the will to believe.</p> <p>James points out that the project of inquiry has two, potentially conflicting, motivations: the desire to believe truths, and the desire to avoid believing falsehoods. Sometimes, jumping to a conclusion that goes beyond our evidence may better serve the goals of inquiry, even when there’s a risk of the conclusion being false.</p> <p>The collaborative inquiry has the same motivations, and sometimes putting something out there, even if it isn’t known to be true, can be valuable to the exchange as a whole. This can be done with all the more confidence when one can trust in her interlocutor to correct such posits to the best of her ability.</p> <p>I’m not sure about the name “correctible”. I’m thinking that, in honor of James, a fittingly provocative name may be “leap”.</p> </h4> <p>I’ve been thinking a lot lately about a class of expression that I’m calling “correctibles”.

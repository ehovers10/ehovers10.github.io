	<h2>Jamesian inquiry</h2>

<p>William James famously drew a distinction between two independent and sometimes conflicting goals for those engaged in the pursuit of knowledge.  The first is to acquire true beliefs.  The second is to avoid believing falsehoods.  One could meet the goal of believing truths simply by believing everything, but doing so sacrifices entirely the second goal.  And one could meet the goal of avoiding falsehoods by believing nothing at all, thereby forfeiting the virtue of believing truths. As James saw it, a strategy of inquiry that floats between these extremes is the path we ought to search for.</p>

<p>James admits that the second goal, that of avoiding false belief, seems to carry more sway, especially in the realm of scientific inquiry.  Belief is conceptually tied to action, and while acting on false belief is frought with peril, failing to act due to failure to believe more rarely leads to trouble.  But sometimes non-action is itself action, and peril can find those who remain in one place as well as those who run into its path.  James&#39; project was to characterize the situations in which inquiry optimization favors the goal of truth acquisition, even at the potential expense of error avoidance.  His proposal, famously, was that for situations in which one&#39;s belief choice is <em>live</em>, <em>forced</em>, and <em>momentous</em>, the will to believe outstrips the fear of being wrong. Unfortunately, this category leaves out most quotidian inquiries; perhaps some people ponder the existence of God on a daily basis, but most of us are happy just to complete our grocery shopping all in one trip.</p>

<p>So, it&#39;s not clear that the Jamesian model can be applied to inquiry generally.  In so far as the goal of inquiry is ultimately knowledgeable action, it may be better to take the conservative approach of only modifying the shared information state in the presence of certainty. Still, the interpretation of <code>live&#39;&#39;,</code>momentous&#39;&#39; and ``forced&#39;&#39; all depend on the relevant context.  Few, if any, decisions are forced <em>simpliciter</em>, but many seem unavoidable given simple background considerations.  I don&#39;t have to pick up either seitan or tofu from the store, but given certain desires I have -- to get protein without harming too many folks along the way, I&#39;ve got to make up my mind before the store closes.  So, one could expand James&#39; proposal to cover certain everyday inquiries simply by taking his criteria to involve restricted quantification over possibilities.</p>

<p>But the adventurous inquirer need not accept context&#39;s life preserver.  Even James, the arch supported of faith-based belief, has restricted his spectulative endeavors too far.  Inquiry need not be momentous or forced for the jump to conclusions to be fruitful.  James&#39; model makes inquiry an optimization task, between taking on too many falsehoods and leaving out too many truths.  And it is a task that is undertaken by fallible individuals in real time.  It is <em>because</em> not every inquiry is momentous that striving for truth (and risking falsehood) is sometimes to be prefered. Inquiries can withstand failures.  This is in part because not every choice is a matter of life or death, but also because inquiries are packaged with corrective feedback mechanisms.  The principle  one of which is the inquirer&#39;s fellow interlocutors.</p>

<p>Disagreement is the tool by which interlocutors can check each other&#39;s flights of fancy.  And, I maintain, it is a tool we both know how to wield, and are prepared to let others weild against us.  The primary role of joint inquiry is to expedite what would be an extremely tedious task if attempted alone.  Even alone, the task can be sped up via judicious application of speculative intellectual leaps; though the risk involved cannot be wholly eliminated.  The collaborative facet of joint inquiry provides extra motivation for assuming the risk -- the cooperative interlocutor, to the extent she is able, will pull you back from the ledge by voicing her disagreement. </p>

<p>David Lewis spoke of language as a convention of truth and trust in a community.  His idea was that our shared language is supported by a tacit agreement to speak truthfully, and to trust that others will do so as well.  While the Jamesian accepts the importance of speaking truthfully, she maintains that the convention may sometimes call for speaking rather than remaining silent even when truth cannot be guaranteed.  The importance of trust remains paramount, but it is not just the hearers&#39; trust in the speaker to utter truly.  It is also the speaker&#39;s trust in his hearer&#39;s to correct him when he doesn&#39;t.</p>

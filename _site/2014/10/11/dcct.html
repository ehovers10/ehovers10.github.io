<p>The standard way of analyzing focus interpreation involves three components.  The focus imposes a structure on the sentence, dividing the semantic subject (focus) from the semantic predicate (topic).  The focus additionally determines a focus semantic value, an alternative set derived from abstracting over the focus and applying the topic to all elements of the domain of the same type as the focus.  Finally, there is a fellicity condition associated with the focus.  The sentence is interpretable only if prior discourse provides a semantic value that is identical to the (properly contextually constrained) focus semantic value.</p>

<p>Interestingly, focus does not always neatly divide the informational structure of a sentence into the already given topic material and the newly contributed focus material. The intonational stress indicative of focus can also appear within the semantic predicate.  In this occurrence, the focus is labeled <em>contrastive topic</em>. While there are distinctive differences in tone, contrastive topic appears to be serving a similar function as focus generally, and it would be nice to subsume it under the same interpretational schema. While greatly successful, his proposal presented above appears to run into trouble when applied to contrastive topic.</p>

<p>The primary issue is that in clearly fellicitous uses of contrastive topic, the fellicity condition mentioned above need not be met.  That is, the alternative set that would be generated by the element focused by contrastive topic need not have an explicit conversational antecedent. Consider the following brief dialogue:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A. What were the animals doing?</li>
  <li>B. The animals were [gamboling about]<sub>f</sub>.</li>
  <li>C. The [horses]<sub>cf</sub> munched grass.</li>
</ul>

<p>Given the question, the focus fellicity condition calls for a response of the form offered in B, but, while incongruent with the question, C is perfectly fellicitous.</p>

<p>But no <em>explicit</em> antecendent does not mean no antecedent whatsoever. Building off of Craige Roberts’ notion of the <em>question under discussion</em>, which posits the presence of merely implicit, or accommodated, questions on the conversational scoreboard, Daniel Büring has suggested that contrastive topic be understood as presupposing a subquestion of the primary question under discussion.  The structured set of questions and subquestions constitutes a plan of inquiry for the conversation.  The upshot is that a sentence involving contrastive topic is fellicitously uttered only if it provides a complete answer to a subquestion within the plan of inquiry for the conversation underway.</p>

<p>The fruitfullness of the question under discussion paradigm for the conversational scoreboard certainly provides Büring’s enrichment with a firm precedent.  But it is not without its challenges.  I will examine three such challenges, one theoretical, one conceptual, and the last empirical.</p>

<p>The theoretical issue has to do with the proposal’s reliance on implicit (or accommodated) antecedents for the contrastive topic to reference.

<p>But it just doesn’t <em>feel</em> like this is all there is to the contribution of contrastive topic.  Contrastive topic isn’t applied just to signal that one is picking up on an elusive bit of the prior conversation; one uses contrastive topic to signal a change in the conversation.</p>

<p>To give this paper tiger a little more bite, let’s examine the empirical issue with the enriched QUD proposal.  Büring’s focus is on contrastive topic in response to an explicit question, but the following discourse appears to invoke the same interpretive principle:</p>

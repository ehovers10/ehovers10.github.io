	<h2>Correctibles, posits, or leaps?</h2>
	<h4>2014-09-10</h4>
	
	<p>I&#39;ve been thinking a lot lately about a class of expression that I&#39;m calling &quot;correctibles&quot;.  The idea behind these expressions (or perhaps better, use of expressions) is that they exhibit a certain resiliance to correction.  For instance, I think that generics and certain relative expressions are in this class.</p>

<p>If I say &quot;Cows give milk&quot;, and you challenge me with &quot;What about bulls?&quot;, it may not be out of line for me to respond, &quot;I didn&#39;t say all cows!&quot;  Your challenge has force, but my original contribution can sail through at least mostly intact.  Similarly, if you say &quot;I know that my car is parked out back&quot;, and I challenge you to prove you aren&#39;t a brain in a vat, you could probably retort, &quot;I didn&#39;t say I could convince a skeptic!&quot;</p>

<p>Assuming there&#39;s a genuine linguistic phenomenon here and that a uniform class of (use of) expressions can be determined, I think these correctibles can give us some interesting insight into discourse dynamics.  The idea is that correctibles have a corrective potential built into their semantic contribution.  Speakers may choose to use a correctible knowing that they may be challenged on it.  And the impact of its use may depend on whether a challenge arises.  Thus, correctibles provide a nice example of the collaborative effort of discourse development.  The nature of my contribution can depend on how you choose to make use of it.</p>

<p>The collaborative nature of the communicative exchange seems pretty obvious, but the particularly disputative aspect of corrective communication has some cool motivations.  Two of my favorites are John Stuart Mill&#39;s approach to disagreement, and William James&#39; notion of the will to believe.</p>

<p>James points out that the project of inquiry has two, potentially conflicting, motivations: the desire to believe truths, and the desire to avoid believing falsehoods.  Sometimes, jumping to a conclusion that goes beyond our evidence may better serve the goals of inquiry, even when there&#39;s a risk of the conclusion being false.</p>

<p>The collaborative inquiry has the same motivations, and sometimes putting something out there, even if it isn&#39;t known to be true, can be valuable to the exchange as a whole.  This can be done with all the more confidence when one can trust in her interlocutor to correct such posits to the best of her ability.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure about the name &quot;correctible&quot;.  I&#39;m thinking that, in honor of James, a fittingly provocative name may be &quot;leap&quot;.</p>
